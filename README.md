**Note:** All documentation in this repo is available as rendered/searchable HTML [here](https://aws.github.io/modern-data-architecture-accelerator/).

The Modern Data Architecture Accelerator (MDAA) deploys secure, compliant modern Data and AI architectures on AWS in minutes. Pick a starter kit, fill in your environment details, and deploy — MDAA handles security compliance, encryption, and IAM best practices automatically.

## Why MDAA

Building a secure, compliant data and AI platform on AWS typically takes months of architecture design, security reviews, and infrastructure coding. MDAA compresses that into minutes. You get production-ready infrastructure that passes compliance audits on day one — not after weeks of remediation.

- **Minutes, not months**: Deploy a complete data lake, ML platform, or GenAI backend in 15–45 minutes instead of building from scratch.
- **Compliance without compromise**: Every module enforces encryption, least-privilege IAM, and audit logging by default. No shortcuts, no security debt.
- **Focus on your problem, not plumbing**: Spend time on data, models, and business logic — not on writing CloudFormation, debugging IAM policies, or passing security reviews.

## Uses

MDAA can be used to build an architecture to solve any variety of data or AI problem, including:

Additionally, MDAA can be used to build complex, multi-domain and multi-account data and AI architectures:

## Key Features

- **Deploy in minutes, not months**: Starter kits go from zero to a working environment in 15–45 minutes. No custom code required.
- **Security and compliance built in**: All modules enforce encryption, least-privilege IAM, and audit logging. Validated against AWS Solutions, NIST 800-53, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS rulesets.
- **Configuration-driven**: Define your environment in YAML files. Change what you need, leave the rest as secure defaults.
- **Extend as you grow**: Start with a kit, then add modules for analytics, AI, governance, or data pipelines as your needs evolve.
- **Multi-account and multi-region**: Deploy across accounts and regions with built-in cross-account trust.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22.x](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm 10.x](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- AWS credentials configured with appropriate permissions ([AWS CLI setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html))

### 1. Pick a Starter Kit

Start by identifying the business problem you need to solve, then select the starter kit that provides the best coverage of required capabilities. Starter kits are just starting points — deploy as-is or modify and extend with additional [modules](#available-modules) and configurations to match your requirements. If necessary, MDAA deployments can be further customized through [code-level escape hatches](CUSTOMIZATION.md).

![MDAA Working Backwards](docs/working_backwards_starter_kit.png)

| Starter Kit | What you get | Est. Deploy Time |
|---|---|---|
| [Minimal](starter_kits/minimal/README.md) | IAM roles, Glue Catalog encryption, LakeFormation settings — build from scratch | ~5–10 min |
| [GenAI Foundation](starter_kits/genai_foundation/README.md) | Enterprise-ready Bedrock Agent with RAG and knowledge bases | ~10–15 min |
| [GenAI GAIA Chatbot](starter_kits/genai_gaia_chatbot/README.md) | RAG chatbot backend with document search, auth, and streaming API | ~10–15 min |
| [Basic DataLake](starter_kits/basic_datalake/README.md) | Encrypted S3 storage, data catalog, SQL queries, audit trail | ~15–20 min |
| [Basic DataScience Platform](starter_kits/basic_datascience_platform/README.md) | Notebook environment with shared data lake and team isolation | ~20–30 min |
| [MLOps Platform](starter_kits/mlops_platform/README.md) | Automated train → deploy → monitor pipeline for ML models | ~20–30 min |
| [DataZone Governed Lakehouse](starter_kits/datazone_governed_lakehouse/README.md) | Data lake with row/column-level security and a data product catalog | ~20–25 min |
| [SMUS Research Environment](starter_kits/smus_research_environment/README.md) | Self-service ML platform for multiple research teams | ~20–25 min |
| [Health Data Accelerator](starter_kits/health_data_accelerator/README.md) | Automated pipeline from source databases to a curated data lake | ~30–45 min |
| [SMUS Data Mesh](starter_kits/smus_data_mesh/README.md) | Multi-account data platform with cross-team data sharing | ~30–45 min |

### 2. Copy the starter kit configs to your own directory:

Copy the contents of your chosen starter kit from `starter_kits/<kit-name>/` into your own project directory. These are plain YAML files — no build tools or dependencies required.

```bash
cp -r starter_kits/basic_datalake ./my-project
cd ./my-project
```

Address the `# TODO:` comments in the config files (org name, account details, CDK Nag suppressions).

### 3. Follow the starter kit's README

Each kit includes a Deployment section with prerequisites, configuration steps, and deploy commands. See the [starter kit's README](#1-pick-a-starter-kit) for details (README will also be in the created starter config directory).

For general deployment guidance, see [PREDEPLOYMENT](PREDEPLOYMENT.md) and [DEPLOYMENT](DEPLOYMENT.md).

### 4. Use and extend

Once deployed, start using your new architecture (see the kit's USAGE.md) or enhance it with additional capabilities from the [available modules](#available-modules).

## Using and Extending MDAA

MDAA can be used and extended in three ways:

### Configuration-Driven Deployment

Deploy compliant, end-to-end data and AI environments using YAML config files and the MDAA CLI. No code required - accessible to all roles, from simple to complex deployments with high compliance assurance.

### Code-Driven Custom Environments

Build custom data and AI environments using MDAA's reusable CDK constructs. Multi-language support (TypeScript, Python, Java, .NET) for L2 constructs; L3 constructs are currently TypeScript-only.

### Workload Integration

Independently developed workloads (CDK or CloudFormation) can leverage MDAA-deployed resources via the standard set of SSM (Systems Manager) parameters published by all MDAA modules.

### Metrics Collection

This solution collects anonymous operational metrics to help AWS improve quality and features. For more information, including how to disable this capability, see the [CDK version reporting documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html#version_reporting).
