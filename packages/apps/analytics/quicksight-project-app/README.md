# QuickSight Project

> **Note:** This documentation is also available in a rendered format [here](https://aws.github.io/modern-data-architecture-accelerator/packages/apps/analytics/quicksight-project-app/index.html).

Deploys QuickSight shared folders with hierarchical permissions and data sources (Redshift, Athena, etc.) for organizing and governing QuickSight assets across teams. Use this module when you need to organize QuickSight dashboards and data sources into team-level folders with controlled access permissions.

## Deployed Resources

This module deploys and integrates the following resources:

**QuickSight Shared Folders** - Creates QuickSight Shared Folders (Root and Child Folders with Permissions to QS Groups)

- Each shared folder can have read or read/write permissions granted for QS principals
- Each shared folder can have child folders with their own permissions

**QuickSight Data Sources** - QS data sources which can be used within QS Datasets and Analysis

**IAM Managed Policy** - When `resourceAccessRolePermissions` is configured, attaches a data-source-specific managed policy (AWS managed policies plus S3/KMS permissions) to the account-level QuickSight resource-access role so data sources can reach their underlying AWS resources (Athena/S3/KMS)

**Redshift IAM Auth Role** - For a Redshift data source configured with `iamParameters`, creates a QuickSight-assumable IAM role scoped to the cluster (`redshift:GetClusterCredentials`) so the data source authenticates without Secrets Manager

**Secrets Manager Grant** - When a data source is configured with `secretsManager`, attaches a managed policy granting the account-level QuickSight Secrets Manager role (`aws-quicksight-secretsmanager-role-v0`) read access to the secret (and decrypt on its KMS key)

## Security/Compliance Details

This module is designed in alignment with MDAA security/compliance principles and CDK nag rulesets. Additional review is recommended prior to production deployment, ensuring organization-specific compliance requirements are met.

- **Least Privilege**:
  - Shared folders support granular read/read-write permissions per QuickSight principal (users and groups)
  - Child folders inherit or override parent permissions
  - Data source permissions scoped per principal with reader/author action sets
- **Separation of Duties**:
  - Data source credentials can be dynamically retrieved from Secrets Manager (recommended, supports rotation) or referenced via static credential pairs

## Configuration

### MDAA Config

Add the following snippet to your mdaa.yaml under the `modules:` section of a domain/env in order to use this module:

```yaml
quicksight-project: # Module Name can be customized
  module_path: '@aws-mdaa/quicksight-project' # Must match module NPM package name
  module_configs:
    - ./quicksight-project.yaml # Filename/path can be customized
```

### Module Config Samples and Variants

Copy the contents of the relevant sample config below into the `./quicksight-project.yaml` file referenced in the MDAA config snippet above.

#### Minimal Configuration

Deploys a shared folder and an Athena data source. Start here for a quick QuickSight project setup before adding Redshift sources, multi-LOB folder hierarchies, or VPC connectivity.

[sample-config-minimal.yaml](sample_configs/sample-config-minimal.yaml)

```yaml
# Contents available via above link
--8<-- "target/docs/packages/apps/analytics/quicksight-project-app/sample_configs/sample-config-minimal.yaml"
```

#### Comprehensive Configuration

Sets up QuickSight principals, a Redshift data source with secret-based credentials, VPC connectivity, SSL properties, and a multi-LOB shared folder hierarchy with dev/test/prod/self-serve/datasets tiers and granular permissions. Use this as a reference when you need full control over data source connectivity, folder organization, and team-level access policies.

[sample-config-comprehensive.yaml](sample_configs/sample-config-comprehensive.yaml)

```yaml
# Contents available via above link
--8<-- "target/docs/packages/apps/analytics/quicksight-project-app/sample_configs/sample-config-comprehensive.yaml"
```

#### Copy Source Configuration

Uses copied credentials from another data source to share credentials across multiple data sources without duplicating secret references. Choose this variant when you have multiple data sources that should authenticate with the same credentials managed in a single location.

[sample-config-copysource.yaml](sample_configs/sample-config-copysource.yaml)

```yaml
# Contents available via above link
--8<-- "target/docs/packages/apps/analytics/quicksight-project-app/sample_configs/sample-config-copysource.yaml"
```

#### Credential Pair Configuration

Uses direct username/password credentials for data source connectivity instead of secret ARN-based authentication. This approach does not support automatic secret rotation. Choose this variant for development or testing environments where Secrets Manager integration is not required.

[sample-config-credentialpair.yaml](sample_configs/sample-config-credentialpair.yaml)

```yaml
# Contents available via above link
--8<-- "target/docs/packages/apps/analytics/quicksight-project-app/sample_configs/sample-config-credentialpair.yaml"
```

#### Secrets Manager Configuration

Authenticates a Redshift data source with a Secrets Manager secret. Setting `secretsManager` wires the secret as the data source credentials and grants the account-level QuickSight Secrets Manager role read access to it. Choose this variant for secret-based authentication with rotation support.

[sample-config-secretsmanager.yaml](sample_configs/sample-config-secretsmanager.yaml)

```yaml
# Contents available via above link
--8<-- "target/docs/packages/apps/analytics/quicksight-project-app/sample_configs/sample-config-secretsmanager.yaml"
```
