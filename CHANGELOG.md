# Change Log

## [NEXT_RELEASE_VERSION] - NEXT_RELEASE_DATE

### New Starter Kits

- **GenAI GAIA Chatbot** — RAG chatbot backend with document search, auth, and streaming API
- **Lakehouse Analytics** — End-to-end lakehouse spanning data lake, governance, dataops, and consumption (Athena + Redshift QuickSight data sources) with sample ETL/crawler dataops and a full deploy walkthrough
- **Minimal** — Starting point for custom configurations with base governance
- **MLOps Platform** — Automated train → deploy → monitor pipeline for ML models

### Starter Kit Changes

- Renamed `genai_accelerator` → `genai_foundation`
- Renamed `governed_lakehouse` → `datazone_governed_lakehouse`
- Standardized READMEs across all starter kits
- Removed top-level `sample_blueprints/` and `sample_configs/` directories. Equivalent examples are available in the [external sample configurations repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-config-modern-data-architecture-accelerator).
- Renamed `sample_code/` → `sample_customizations/`

### New Features

#### DataOps Aurora Module

- New `@aws-mdaa/dataops-aurora` module: Aurora Serverless v2 cluster deployment with enterprise security
  - Supports multiple named PostgreSQL clusters per module (MySQL planned)
  - Config schema with top-level `postgresql` category object and named cluster maps
  - KMS encryption (project key or dedicated shared key), VPC isolation, enhanced monitoring
  - IAM database authentication, CloudWatch log exports, automatic admin password rotation
  - Per-cluster access managed policy with `rds-db:connect`, `rds:Describe*`, and Secrets Manager access
  - Top-level `dataAdminRoles` for cross-cluster admin access, per-cluster `clusterAccessRoles`
  - DataOps project integration for shared KMS key auto-wiring via `projectName`
  - Comprehensive, minimal, and no-project sample configs with inline documentation

### DataOps Module Changes

#### DataOps Job Module

- Expanded the supported `workerType` values beyond `Standard`, `G.1X`, and `G.2X` to include the larger general-purpose G family (`G.4X`, `G.8X`, `G.12X`, `G.16X`) and the memory-optimized R family (`R.1X`, `R.2X`, `R.4X`, `R.8X`) for demanding and memory-intensive ETL workloads. Existing configurations are unaffected (backwards compatible). Note: `G.12X`, `G.16X`, and all R types require a compatible Glue version and regional availability; incompatible combinations surface as CloudFormation deploy-time errors rather than at synth.

### Data Science/AI/ML Changes

#### Bedrock AgentCore Runtime Module

- Added optional `allowedModelArns` configuration parameter to scope execution role Bedrock model invocation permissions to specific model ARNs for least-privilege access
- Added optional `enforceVpcOnly` configuration to restrict JWT/OAuth callers to VPC-only invocation via an auto-generated resource-based policy
- Added optional `networkConfiguration.vpcId` field (required when `enforceVpcOnly` is true) to identify the VPC for the resource policy condition
- Added new `@aws-mdaa/agentcore-shared` package for shared AgentCore construct utilities (reusable by future Gateway module)
- Added built-in log data protection: customer-managed KMS encryption and CloudWatch Data Protection PII masking are now always applied to the service-created runtime log groups on every deployment. A built-in comprehensive set of PII identifiers (email addresses, credit card numbers, SSNs, names, addresses, US phone numbers, IP addresses) is always masked. Upgrade impact: existing deployments will gain a new KMS key, a Data Protection policy, and a log-protection custom resource on next deploy.
- Added optional `dataProtection.additionalIdentifiers` configuration to mask additional AWS-managed data identifiers on top of the built-in set. This field is additive only and cannot reduce the built-in masking baseline. Breaking change: replaces the previous `dataProtection.enabled`/`dataProtection.identifiers` configuration — protection is no longer opt-in and the identifier list can no longer be narrowed. Existing configs using the old keys will be silently ignored; remove them to avoid confusion.
- Added optional `logRetentionDays` configuration to set CloudWatch Logs retention on the runtime log groups (defaults to 30 days)
- Migrated to typed `CfnRuntime`/`CfnRuntimeEndpoint` constructs for compile-time validation of property names/shapes. Logical IDs unchanged. Upgrade impact: existing runtimes will gain standard MDAA stack tags on next deploy — in-place tag update with no resource replacement.

#### Bedrock Builder Module

- Added SSM parameters and CloudFormation outputs identifying deployed resource IDs, making them discoverable for downstream consumers: Bedrock Agent (id, ARN, alias id), Aurora PgVector vector store (cluster endpoint and secret name), OpenSearch Serverless collection (id, ARN), and the OpenSearch Serverless VPC endpoints. Upgrade impact: additive only — new SSM parameters and stack outputs appear on the next deploy; no existing resources are modified.

#### RDS Constructs

- `MdaaAuroraPgVector`: the default engine version is now `16.13`, as `16.6` has reached the end of support.

### Data Analytics Changes

#### QuickSight Namespace Module

- Added an optional `enableEmailSyncing` flag (default `false`) to each federation configuration. When enabled, the SAML federation role trust policy also grants `sts:TagSession`, scoped by conditions to only the `Email` session tag. This enables QuickSight email syncing for federated users.

#### QuickSight Account and Project Modules

- Added optional `resourceAccessRolePermissions` to grant the QuickSight resource-access role (`aws-quicksight-service-role-v0`) the AWS-managed policies and S3/KMS access its data sources need; the `quicksight-account` module owns the role while `quicksight-project` attaches data-source-specific grants.
- Added optional `secretsManager` authentication for data sources in the `quicksight-project` module.

### Governance Module Changes

#### Audit Trail Module

- Added optional `eventSelectors` configuration to scope CloudTrail S3 data event capture to specific buckets and key prefixes instead of logging all S3 data events account-wide. Each selector accepts a `bucketName` (or SSM parameter reference) and an optional `objectPrefix`. When omitted, the existing behavior (capture all S3 data events) is preserved.
- Added a new `trails` configuration property accepting a map of named trail configurations. Each key becomes the trail's resource name segment, enabling multiple independent trails with separate S3 destinations, KMS keys, and event selectors in a single deployment. The existing `trail` property is now deprecated — migrate to `trails` with a key of `'s3-audit'` for equivalent behavior. Both properties can coexist during migration.

### Utility Module Changes

#### EC2 Module

- Added optional `rules` configuration to authorize additional ingress/egress rules on pre-existing (externally-owned) security groups referenced by id (supports `ssm:` references). Unlike `securityGroups`, it creates no security group; each rule renders to a standalone `SecurityGroupIngress`/`SecurityGroupEgress` resource, enabling connectivity between two security groups owned by different modules without a circular cross-stack dependency.

#### CLI

- Module deployment hook commands now resolve `{{context:<key>}}` references against the module's effective context.
- The `mdaa` CLI now validates `--domain`, `--env`, and `--module` filter values against the loaded config and fails fast with an error listing the unknown value(s) and the valid options, instead of silently matching nothing.

### Core Framework Changes

- **Naming**: Added `MdaaResourceType` enum and `withResourceType()` method to `IMdaaResourceNaming` interface, enabling custom naming modules to inject service-type abbreviations of the implementer's choosing into resource names (the abbreviations themselves are not produced by the enum). The default implementation is unchanged — no impact on existing deployments.

### Deprecations

- **GAIA v1 removal target set to v1.9.0**: `@aws-mdaa/gaia` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-l3-construct` (GAIA v1), deprecated in favor of `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2-l3-construct`, now have a firm removal target of **v1.9.0**. Previously the removal was documented only as "a future release". v1 remains published and functional for existing deployments until then and will not receive new features. See [MIGRATION_TO_V2.md](packages/apps/ai/gaia-app/MIGRATION_TO_V2.md) for migration guidance.
- **Bedrock Agent module deprecation**: `@aws-mdaa/bedrock-agent-l3-construct` is deprecated, as the Amazon Bedrock Agents service will no longer be open to new customers starting on July 30, 2026. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. We will support similar capabilities in the next release.
- **SageMaker Ground Truth and Model Monitoring modules deprecation**: `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-ground-truth-l3-construct` and `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-model-monitoring-l3-construct` are deprecated, as both services will no longer be open to new customers starting on July 30, 2026. Existing customers can continue to use both services as normal. We will support similar capabilities in the next release.

### General Changes

- **aws-cdk-lib upgrade to 2.258.0**: `aws-cdk-lib` has been updated from 2.192.0 to 2.258.0. This version removes the `lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_13` enum value and upgrades it to `Runtime.PYTHON_3_14`. Any MDAA config that references `python3.13` as a Lambda runtime must be updated to `python3.13t` (thread-based) or another supported runtime (e.g., `python3.14`).
- Updated dependencies to address CVEs (`cryptography`, `requests`, `yaml`, `fast-xml-parser`, `follow-redirects`, `tmp`, `pytest`)

### Bug Fixes
- Added allowlist validation of `region` (`^[a-z0-9-]+$`) and `account` (12-digit) config values before they are interpolated into CLI shell commands, at both config-parse time (for concrete values) and after reference resolution. Dynamic references (`{{...}}`) and the `default` sentinel are unaffected.
- Fixed intermittent deployment failures caused by concurrent `AWS::DataZone::Owner` creation triggering DynamoDB transaction collisions (`Transaction cancelled ... ConditionalCheckFailed ... AlreadyExists`). `CfnOwner` resources that target the same domain unit are now chained sequentially via CloudFormation `DependsOn`, eliminating the race; owners on different domain units remain parallel. The chain order is derived from the owner construct id, so reordering a config's owner list produces no template change.
- Fixed cross-account SMUS deploy failure in DataZone v2 domain config handler due to insufficient IAM authorization after recent AWS service update
- Fixed DataOps Project cross-account resource link creation (one resource link per account)
- Fixed missing KMS encryption on Data Warehouse cluster events SNS topic
- Fixed GAIA v2 REST API missing per-method and per-user throttling
- Fixed GAIA v2 REST API pagination tokens to be opaque and versioned
- Fixed GAIA (v1) CDK synth failure caused by unsuppressed `IAMNoInlinePolicy` (NIST/HIPAA/PCI) findings on the CDK-managed S3 bucket-notifications handler for the RAG data-import upload bucket

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-22

#### Generative AI Accelerator v2 Module

- New `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2` app and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2-l3-construct` providing an authenticated GenAI chatbot platform; successor to `@aws-mdaa/gaia`
- AppSync Events API for real-time bidirectional streaming, fronted by Cognito User Pool authentication with optional external OIDC (e.g., Entra ID)
- Pluggable data source model — exactly one of Bedrock Knowledge Base RAG, direct Bedrock model invocation with streaming, or customer-provided Lambda
- Optional client and admin CloudFront UIs with custom-domain and ACM certificate support
- Chat history, feedback, and service-interruption banner backed by KMS-encrypted DynamoDB tables
- WAF protection (regional and global), VPC-attached Lambda execution, and synth-time validation of misconfigurations

- Generic `buildPolicies` configuration for attaching custom IAM policies (managed policy ARNs or inline policy documents) to CodeBuild pipeline roles, with optional CDK Nag suppressions
- Registry authentication for CodeArtifact, Artifactory, GitLab, etc. is now handled entirely in user buildspecs
- Optional CodeArtifact integration alongside public npm support

#### SageMaker L2 Constructs

- Added `MdaaSageMakerProjectTemplate`, `MdaaGroundTruth`, and `MdaaModelMonitor` for ML lifecycle management

### Data Science/AI/ML Changes

#### Data Science Team Module

- Added optional MLflow tracking server configuration to the team's SageMaker Studio domain for experiment tracking
- Added per-user JupyterLab space provisioning via the new `jupyterLab` configuration

#### Bedrock AgentCore Runtime Module

- Added `enableTransactionSearch` configuration parameter to optionally skip X-Ray Transaction Search Config creation when the resource already exists
- Added `protocolConfiguration` configuration parameter for runtime protocol selection
- Removed unneeded resource policy from the runtime construct

#### RDS Constructs

- `MdaaAuroraPgVector`: engine version is now configurable via the `engineVersion` prop (default `16.6`). The default is provided for backward compatibility but is not maintained long-term — explicitly set the engine version to avoid future breakage
- `MdaaRdsServerlessCluster`: reader instance count is now configurable via the `numberOfReaderInstances` prop (default `1`)
- `BedrockKnowledgeBase` L3 construct: `engineVersion` from vector store config is now passed through to the Aurora PgVector cluster

### DataOps Module Changes

#### Data Quality Module

- Added multi-source support for rulesets — each ruleset can specify Glue, S3, or Redshift as its data source via a `source` block, with metadata published to SSM for downstream DQ evaluation jobs
- Added recommendation-based rulesets via `recommendationRunId`, delegating rule generation to Glue DQ recommendations
- Added dynamic target discovery via `dynamicTargets` for runtime dataset enumeration by DQ evaluation jobs
- Added `smusPublishing` configuration for publishing data quality metrics to SageMaker Unified Studio (DataZone)
- Added `smusAssetId` per-ruleset field for mapping DQ results to DataZone assets

#### DataOps Job Module

- Added pre-built data quality evaluation scripts (`dq-main.py`, `dq_config.py`, `smus.py`) enabling deployment of a working DQ evaluation Glue job without writing any code

#### DMS Constructs

- Added `expectedBucketOwner` support to S3 endpoint settings for cross-account bucket protection

### Data Lake Changes

- Added optional S3 Storage Lens support — enable via `storageLensEnabled`
- Added optional CORS support — configure via `corsRules`

### Data Analytics Changes

#### Data Warehouse Module

- Added `multiAz` (multi-AZ high availability) and `backupRegion` (cross-region snapshot copy) configuration options
- Added `publicAccessBlockManagedExternally` option to skip the explicit `BlockPublicAccess` setting on S3 buckets; settable globally via CDK context (`@aws-mdaa/publicAccessBlockManagedExternally: true`) or as a per-module property
- Fixed type for `parameterGroupParams` configuration

### Governance Module Changes

#### DataZone/SMUS Modules

- Added simplified `authorizations` interface for domain and domain unit configuration, supporting `projectCreators`, `eligibleProjectMembers`, `domainUnitCreators`, `glossaryCreators`, and `environmentCreators` as a concise alternative to full `authorizationPolicies` objects
- `authorizationPolicies` and `authorizations` are now supported at the root domain level (`BaseDomainProps`), not just on individual domain units
- Domain owners (users, groups, and associated account CDK users) now automatically receive version-aware project creation authorization policies in addition to `ADD_TO_PROJECT_MEMBER_POOL`
- Deprecated `allowAllUsers`, `allowedUsers`, and `allowedGroups` on domain units in favor of `authorizations.eligibleProjectMembers` or `authorizationPolicies`. Switching from these deprecated properties requires a two-step migration: first remove the deprecated properties and deploy, then add the new configuration and redeploy. A single-step migration will produce `PolicyGrant` conflicts.

#### Account-Level Modules

- Glue Catalog, LakeFormation Settings, Macie Session, and QuickSight Account modules now create a static SSM parameter (`/account-module-lock/<module-name>`) that prevents multiple deployments of the same module to a single AWS account

#### Roles Module

- Added optional `additionalTrustedActions` for the role primary principal, allowing extra actions like `sts:TagSession` to be added to the trust policy

### Utility Module Changes

#### CLI

- Added optional permission boundary name input to apply an IAM policy as permission boundary to all IAM roles

### Deprecations

- `@aws-mdaa/gaia` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-l3-construct` (GAIA v1) are deprecated in favor of `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2-l3-construct`
  - v1 packages remain published and functional for existing deployments but will not receive new features
  - v1 packages will be removed in a future major release
  - v2 is a re-architected GAIA backend (Cognito, AppSync Events, CloudFront) and is not a drop-in replacement. See [MIGRATION_TO_V2.md](packages/apps/ai/gaia-app/MIGRATION_TO_V2.md) for guidance

### General Changes

- Every app module now includes `sample-config-minimal.yaml` and `sample-config-comprehensive.yaml` with full schema coverage, inline documentation, and template variables for portability
- All app module READMEs follow a consistent structure with architecture overview, configuration reference, and ordered sample config sections
- Replaced Jest snapshot and synth tests with CDK diff-based baseline testing across all app modules, using the CDK toolkit's semantic diff engine to detect resource changes
- Updated dependencies to address CVEs (`pyjwt`, `ts-jest`, `lodash`, `ajv`, and others)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed IAM Policy cross-stack collision in `dataops-job` and `sm-studio-domain` caused by `BucketDeployment` adding inline policies to imported roles
- Fixed construct ID collision when multiple security groups are defined in a DataOps project
- Fixed model deploy stage IAM policy size overflow in SageMaker MLOps by separating account role responsibilities
- Fixed `MdaaSqsQueue` mis-spelled `encyption` property that prevented the explicit KMS encryption mode from being applied
- Fixed missing ECR permissions in Bedrock AgentCore Runtime when `containerUri` configuration parameter is used
- Fixed SageMaker AI Domain updates failing with "resource already exists" when only mutable settings (default user settings, domain settings) change. Note: changing immutable properties (`AuthMode`, `DomainName`, `KmsKeyId`, `VpcId`) still requires manual domain recreation
- Fixed 403 `PROJECT_CREATE_FAILED` error in same-account DataZone deployments by granting `CREATE_PROJECT` / `CREATE_PROJECT_FROM_PROJECT_PROFILE` and `ADD_TO_PROJECT_MEMBER_POOL` authorization policies to the cfn-exec role and data-admin role on the root domain unit
- Fixed DataZone SageMaker domain child stack not inheriting parent account and region, which caused failures in cross-account deployments
- Fixed DataZone environment naming to use the naming helper with `maxLength` enforcement
- Fixed unique-environment generation in SageMaker projects when the user supplies tooling
- Fixed Lambda Alias `CurrentVersion` no longer being incorrectly flagged by CDK diff baseline testing
- Fixed SageMaker endpoint construct using a non-fixed model name to avoid update conflicts
- Fixed LakeFormation Settings SSO application ARN failing in Control Tower / delegated-admin IdC setups by no longer hardcoding the data platform account ID
