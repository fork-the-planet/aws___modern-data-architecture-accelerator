# Change Log

## [NEXT_RELEASE_VERSION] - NEXT_RELEASE_DATE

### New Starter Kits

- **GenAI GAIA Chatbot** — RAG chatbot backend with document search, auth, and streaming API
- **Lakehouse Analytics** — End-to-end lakehouse spanning data lake, governance, dataops, and consumption (Athena + Redshift QuickSight data sources) with sample ETL/crawler dataops and a full deploy walkthrough
- **Minimal** — Starting point for custom configurations with base governance
- **MLOps Platform** — Automated train → deploy → monitor pipeline for ML models

### Starter Kit Improvements

- Renamed `genai_accelerator` → `genai_foundation`
- Renamed `governed_lakehouse` → `datazone_governed_lakehouse`
- Standardized READMEs across all starter kits

### Cleanup

- Removed top-level `sample_blueprints/` and `sample_configs/` directories. Equivalent examples are available in the [external sample configurations repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-config-modern-data-architecture-accelerator).
- Renamed `sample_code/` → `sample_customizations/`

### New Features

- **Audit Trail Module — Event Selectors**: Added optional `eventSelectors` configuration to the audit-trail module, allowing users to scope CloudTrail S3 data event capture to specific buckets and key prefixes instead of logging all S3 data events account-wide. Each selector accepts a `bucketName` (or SSM parameter reference) and an optional `objectPrefix`. When omitted, the existing behavior (capture all S3 data events) is preserved.

- **Audit Trail Module — Multiple Named Trails**: Added a new `trails` configuration property accepting a map of named trail configurations. Each key becomes the trail's resource name segment, enabling multiple independent trails with separate S3 destinations, KMS keys, and event selectors in a single deployment. The existing `trail` property is now deprecated — migrate to `trails` with a key of `'s3-audit'` for equivalent behavior. Both properties can coexist during migration.

- **aws-cdk-lib upgrade to 2.258.0**: `aws-cdk-lib` has been updated from 2.192.0 to 2.258.0. This version removes the `lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_13` enum value and upgrades it to Runtime.PYTHON_3_14. Any MDAA config that references `python3.13` as a Lambda runtime must be updated to `python3.13t` (thread-based) or another supported runtime (e.g., `python3.14`).
- **Naming**: Added `MdaaResourceType` enum and `withResourceType()` method to `IMdaaResourceNaming` interface, enabling custom naming modules to inject service-type abbreviations of the implementer's choosing into resource names (the abbreviations themselves are not produced by the enum). The default implementation is unchanged — no impact on existing deployments.

- **DataOps Aurora** (`@aws-mdaa/dataops-aurora`): Aurora Serverless v2 cluster deployment with enterprise security
  - Supports multiple named PostgreSQL clusters per module (MySQL planned)
  - Config schema with top-level `postgresql` category object and named cluster maps
  - KMS encryption (project key or dedicated shared key), VPC isolation, enhanced monitoring
  - IAM database authentication, CloudWatch log exports, automatic admin password rotation
  - Per-cluster access managed policy with `rds-db:connect`, `rds:Describe*`, and Secrets Manager access
  - Top-level `dataAdminRoles` for cross-cluster admin access, per-cluster `clusterAccessRoles`
  - DataOps project integration for shared KMS key auto-wiring via `projectName`
  - Comprehensive, minimal, and no-project sample configs with inline documentation
- **S3 Constructs**: Added `publicAccessBlockManagedExternally` option to skip the explicit `BlockPublicAccess` setting on S3 buckets. Set globally via CDK context (`@aws-mdaa/publicAccessBlockManagedExternally: true`) or as a per-module config property in the datawarehouse app (`@aws-mdaa/datawarehouse`)
- **SageMaker MLOps — `buildPolicies` config** (`@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-mlops`, `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-model-training-l3-construct`, `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-model-deploy-l3-construct`): Generic mechanism for attaching custom IAM policies to CodeBuild pipeline roles. Replaces the CodeArtifact-specific `codeArtifact` prop with a flexible `buildPolicies` array supporting managed policy ARNs (`policyArn`) and inline policy documents (`policyDocument`) with optional CDK Nag suppressions. Registry authentication (CodeArtifact, Artifactory, GitLab, etc.) is now handled entirely in the user's buildspec. The `mlops_platform` starter kit is updated with commented examples.
- **Generative AI Accelerator v2** (`@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2`): Authenticated GenAI chatbot platform, successor to `@aws-mdaa/gaia`
  - AppSync Events API for real-time bidirectional streaming to client UIs, fronted by Cognito User Pool authentication (with optional external OIDC such as Entra ID)
  - REST API (API Gateway + Lambda) for session management, feedback, and administrative endpoints
  - Pluggable data source model: Bedrock Knowledge Base RAG (via `@aws-mdaa/bedrock-builder`), direct Bedrock model invocation with streaming, or customer-provided Lambda — exactly one per deployment
  - Optional client and admin CloudFront UIs with KMS-encrypted logging, Origin Access Control, HTTPS-only enforcement (TLS 1.2), and custom-domain + ACM certificate support
  - Chat history, feedback collection, and service-interruption banner managed via DynamoDB tables with KMS encryption and TTL
  - X-Origin verification secret (KMS-encrypted Secrets Manager) to validate that API traffic flows through CloudFront
  - WAF protection (regional + global), VPC-attached Lambda execution, and full CDK Nag compliance
  - Runtime validation rejects misconfigurations at synth time: exactly one data source, Knowledge Base required when `bedrockRagDataSource` is set, authentication requires at least one of `cognitoDomain` or `entraIdOIDCConfiguration`, and `vpc.appSubnets` must be non-empty
  - The `genai_accelerator` starter kit deploys v2 by default
- **SageMaker Ground Truth App** (`@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-ground-truth`): Automated, continuous data labeling pipeline
  - EventBridge + SQS + Step Functions architecture for continuous S3 ingestion → batched labeling
  - Upload/Output S3 buckets with KMS encryption and EventBridge notifications
  - SQS queue with DLQ and CloudWatch alarms for failed items
  - Step Functions state machine orchestrating: poll SQS → create labeling job → wait for completion → (optional) verification job → update Feature Store → return rejected items to queue
  - 5-6 Lambda functions powering the state machine steps
  - SageMaker Feature Group integration for persisting labeled data
  - EventBridge Scheduler for configurable workflow triggers
  - Optional verification labeling job with automatic re-queue of rejected items
  - Full MDAA compliance: MdaaRole, MdaaKmsKey, MdaaBucket, MdaaManagedPolicy, CDK Nag, SSM parameter exports
  - Comprehensive and minimal sample configs with inline documentation
- Added SageMaker L2 constructs: `MdaaSageMakerProjectTemplate`, `MdaaGroundTruth`, and `MdaaModelMonitor` for ML lifecycle management (project templates, data labeling, model monitoring)
- Data Quality App:
  - Added multi-source support for data quality rulesets — each ruleset can now specify a `source` block with `sourceType` (glue, s3, redshift), connection details, and S3 paths. Source metadata is published to SSM for downstream DQ evaluation jobs.
  - Added `smusAssetId` per-ruleset field for mapping DQ results to DataZone assets
  - Added recommendation-based rulesets via `recommendationRunId` — delegates rule generation to Glue DQ recommendations instead of requiring explicit DQDL rules (metadata-only, no CfnDataQualityRuleset created)
  - Added dynamic target discovery via `dynamicTargets` — configure S3 directories for runtime dataset enumeration by DQ evaluation jobs
  - Added `smusPublishing` configuration for publishing data quality metrics to SageMaker Unified Studio (DataZone)
- Agentcore Runtime app:
  - Added enableTransactionSearch(boolean) config param to optionally prevent creation of X-Ray Transaction Search Config if it already exists
  - Added optional `allowedModelArns` configuration parameter to scope execution role Bedrock model invocation permissions to specific model ARNs for least-privilege access
  - Added optional `enforceVpcOnly` configuration to restrict JWT/OAuth callers to VPC-only invocation via an auto-generated resource-based policy
  - Added optional `networkConfiguration.vpcId` field (required when `enforceVpcOnly` is true) to identify the VPC for the resource policy condition
  - Added new `@aws-mdaa/agentcore-shared` package for shared AgentCore construct utilities (reusable by future Gateway module)
  - **Built-in log data protection**: customer-managed KMS encryption and CloudWatch Data Protection PII masking are now always applied to the service-created runtime log groups on every deployment. A built-in comprehensive set of PII identifiers (email addresses, credit card numbers, SSNs, names, addresses, US phone numbers, IP addresses) is always masked. **Upgrade impact**: existing deployments will gain a new KMS key, a Data Protection policy, and a log-protection custom resource on next deploy.
  - Added optional `dataProtection.additionalIdentifiers` configuration to mask additional AWS-managed data identifiers on top of the built-in set. This field is additive only and cannot reduce the built-in masking baseline. **Breaking change**: replaces the previous `dataProtection.enabled`/`dataProtection.identifiers` configuration — protection is no longer opt-in and the identifier list can no longer be narrowed. Existing configs using the old keys will be silently ignored; remove them to avoid confusion.
  - Added optional `logRetentionDays` configuration to set CloudWatch Logs retention on the runtime log groups (defaults to 30 days)
  - **Migrated to typed `CfnRuntime`/`CfnRuntimeEndpoint` constructs**: compile-time validation of property names/shapes. Logical IDs unchanged. **Upgrade impact**: existing runtimes will gain standard MDAA stack tags on next deploy — in-place tag update with no resource replacement.
- Bedrock Builder app: Bedrock Builder constructs now publish SSM parameters and CloudFormation outputs identifying their deployed resource IDs, making them discoverable for downstream consumers: Bedrock Agent (id, ARN, alias id), Aurora PgVector vector store (cluster endpoint and secret name), OpenSearch Serverless collection (id, ARN), and the OpenSearch Serverless VPC endpoints. **Upgrade impact**: additive only — new SSM parameters and stack outputs appear on the next deploy; no existing resources are modified.
- Dataops Job app: added pre-built data quality evaluation scripts enabling users to deploy a working DQ evaluation Glue job without writing any code
- Datalake app:
  - Added optional S3 Storage Lens support — enable via storageLensEnabled: true
  - Added optional CORS support - enable via corsRules property
- CLI: added permission boundary name as an optional input to apply an IAM policy as permission boundary to all IAM roles
- Data Warehouse app: Added `multiAz` (multi-AZ high availability) and `backupRegion` (cross-region snapshot copy) config options
- Roles app: added an optional `additionalTrustedActions` for the role primary principal, allowing additional actions like
  `sts:TagSession` to be added to the trust policy;
- Account-level modules (Glue Catalog, LakeFormation Settings, Macie Session, QuickSight Account) now create a static SSM parameter (`/account-module-lock/<module-name>`) that prevents multiple deployments of the same module to a single AWS account
- DMS Constructs: Added `expectedBucketOwner` support to S3 endpoint settings for cross-account bucket sniping prevention.
- DataZone/SMUS: added simplified `authorizations` interface for domain and domain unit configuration — supports `projectCreators`, `eligibleProjectMembers`, `domainUnitCreators`, `glossaryCreators`, and `environmentCreators` fields as a concise alternative to full `authorizationPolicies` objects
- DataZone/SMUS: `authorizationPolicies` and `authorizations` are now supported on the root domain level (`BaseDomainProps`), not just on individual domain units
- DataZone/SMUS: domain owners (users, groups, and associated account CDK users) now automatically receive version-aware project creation authorization policies in addition to `ADD_TO_PROJECT_MEMBER_POOL`
- **EC2**: Added optional `rules` configuration to the `ec2` module to authorize additional ingress/egress rules on pre-existing (externally-owned) security groups referenced by id (supports `ssm:` references). Unlike `securityGroups`, it creates no security group; each rule renders to a standalone `SecurityGroupIngress`/`SecurityGroupEgress` resource, enabling connectivity between two security groups owned by different modules without a circular cross-stack dependency.
- **QuickSight**: Added optional `resourceAccessRolePermissions` to grant the QuickSight resource-access role (`aws-quicksight-service-role-v0`) the AWS-managed policies and S3/KMS access its data sources need; the `quicksight-account` module owns the role while `quicksight-project` attaches data-source-specific grants. The `quicksight-project` module also gained optional `secretsManager` authentication for data sources.
- **CLI**: Module deployment hook commands now resolve `{{context:<key>}}` references against the module's effective context.
- **CLI**: The `mdaa` CLI now validates `--domain`, `--env`, and `--module` filter values against the loaded config and fails fast with an error listing the unknown value(s) and the valid options, instead of silently matching nothing.
- Fixed intermittent deployment failures caused by concurrent `AWS::DataZone::Owner` creation triggering DynamoDB transaction collisions (`Transaction cancelled ... ConditionalCheckFailed ... AlreadyExists`). `CfnOwner` resources that target the same domain unit are now chained sequentially via CloudFormation `DependsOn`, eliminating the race; owners on different domain units remain parallel. The chain order is derived from the owner construct id, so reordering a config's owner list produces no template change.

### Deprecations

- **GAIA v1 removal target set to v1.9.0**: `@aws-mdaa/gaia` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-l3-construct` (GAIA v1), deprecated in favor of `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2-l3-construct`, now have a firm removal target of **v1.9.0**. Previously the removal was documented only as "a future release". v1 remains published and functional for existing deployments until then and will not receive new features. See [MIGRATION_TO_V2.md](packages/apps/ai/gaia-app/MIGRATION_TO_V2.md) for migration guidance.

### Data Science/AI/ML Changes

#### Data Science Team Module

- Added optional MLflow tracking server configuration to the team's SageMaker Studio domain for experiment tracking
- Added per-user JupyterLab space provisioning via the new `jupyterLab` configuration

#### Bedrock AgentCore Runtime Module

- Added `enableTransactionSearch` configuration parameter to optionally skip X-Ray Transaction Search Config creation when the resource already exists
- Added `protocolConfiguration` configuration parameter for runtime protocol selection
- Removed unneeded resource policy from the runtime construct

#### RDS Constructs

- `MdaaAuroraPgVector`: engine version is now configurable via the `engineVersion` prop (default `16.6`). The default is provided for backward compatibility but is not maintained long-term — explicitly set the engine version to avoid future breakage
- `MdaaRdsServerlessCluster`: reader instance count is now configurable via the `numberOfReaderInstances` prop (default `1`)
- `BedrockKnowledgeBase` L3 construct: `engineVersion` from vector store config is now passed through to the Aurora PgVector cluster

### DataOps Module Changes

#### Data Quality Module

- Added multi-source support for rulesets — each ruleset can specify Glue, S3, or Redshift as its data source via a `source` block, with metadata published to SSM for downstream DQ evaluation jobs
- Added recommendation-based rulesets via `recommendationRunId`, delegating rule generation to Glue DQ recommendations
- Added dynamic target discovery via `dynamicTargets` for runtime dataset enumeration by DQ evaluation jobs
- Added `smusPublishing` configuration for publishing data quality metrics to SageMaker Unified Studio (DataZone)
- Added `smusAssetId` per-ruleset field for mapping DQ results to DataZone assets

### Governance Module Changes

#### DataZone/SMUS Modules

- Added simplified `authorizations` interface for domain and domain unit configuration, supporting `projectCreators`, `eligibleProjectMembers`, `domainUnitCreators`, `glossaryCreators`, and `environmentCreators` as a concise alternative to full `authorizationPolicies` objects
- `authorizationPolicies` and `authorizations` are now supported at the root domain level (`BaseDomainProps`), not just on individual domain units
- Domain owners (users, groups, and associated account CDK users) now automatically receive version-aware project creation authorization policies in addition to `ADD_TO_PROJECT_MEMBER_POOL`
- Deprecated `allowAllUsers`, `allowedUsers`, and `allowedGroups` on domain units in favor of `authorizations.eligibleProjectMembers` or `authorizationPolicies`. Switching from these deprecated properties requires a two-step migration: first remove the deprecated properties and deploy, then add the new configuration and redeploy. A single-step migration will produce `PolicyGrant` conflicts.

#### Account-Level Modules

- Glue Catalog, LakeFormation Settings, Macie Session, and QuickSight Account modules now create a static SSM parameter (`/account-module-lock/<module-name>`) that prevents multiple deployments of the same module to a single AWS account

### Utility Module Changes

#### CLI

- Added optional permission boundary name input to apply an IAM policy as permission boundary to all IAM roles

### Deprecations

- `@aws-mdaa/gaia` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-l3-construct` (GAIA v1) are deprecated in favor of `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2-l3-construct`
  - v1 packages remain published and functional for existing deployments but will not receive new features
  - v1 packages will be removed in a future major release
  - v2 is a re-architected GAIA backend (Cognito, AppSync Events, CloudFront) and is not a drop-in replacement. See [MIGRATION_TO_V2.md](packages/apps/ai/gaia-app/MIGRATION_TO_V2.md) for guidance

### General Changes

- Every app module now includes `sample-config-minimal.yaml` and `sample-config-comprehensive.yaml` with full schema coverage, inline documentation, and template variables for portability
- All app module READMEs follow a consistent structure with architecture overview, configuration reference, and ordered sample config sections

- Fixed `MdaaSqsQueue` mis-spelled `encyption` property that prevented the explicit KMS encryption mode from being applied
- Fixed missing ECR permissions in Bedrock AgentCore Runtime when `containerUri` configuration parameter is used
- Fixed SageMaker AI Domain updates failing with "resource already exists" when only mutable settings (default user settings, domain settings) change. Note: changing immutable properties (`AuthMode`, `DomainName`, `KmsKeyId`, `VpcId`) still requires manual domain recreation
- Fixed 403 `PROJECT_CREATE_FAILED` error in same-account DataZone deployments by granting `CREATE_PROJECT` / `CREATE_PROJECT_FROM_PROJECT_PROFILE` and `ADD_TO_PROJECT_MEMBER_POOL` authorization policies to the cfn-exec role and data-admin role on the root domain unit
- Fixed DataZone SageMaker domain child stack not inheriting parent account and region, which caused failures in cross-account deployments
- Fixed DataZone environment naming to use the naming helper with `maxLength` enforcement
- Fixed unique-environment generation in SageMaker projects when the user supplies tooling
- Fixed Lambda Alias `CurrentVersion` no longer being incorrectly flagged by CDK diff baseline testing
- Fixed SageMaker endpoint construct using a non-fixed model name to avoid update conflicts
