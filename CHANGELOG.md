# Change Log

## [NEXT_RELEASE_VERSION] - NEXT_RELEASE_DATE

### New Features

- **Naming**: Added `MdaaResourceType` enum and `withResourceType()` method to `IMdaaResourceNaming` interface, enabling custom naming modules to inject service-type abbreviations of the implementer's choosing into resource names (the abbreviations themselves are not produced by the enum). The default implementation is unchanged — no impact on existing deployments.

### Data Science/AI/ML Changes

#### Bedrock AgentCore Runtime Module

- Added optional `enforceVpcOnly` configuration to restrict JWT/OAuth callers to VPC-only invocation via an auto-generated resource-based policy
- Added optional `networkConfiguration.vpcId` field (required when `enforceVpcOnly` is true) to identify the VPC for the resource policy condition
- Added new `@aws-mdaa/agentcore-shared` package for shared AgentCore construct utilities (reusable by future Gateway module)
- Added optional `allowedModelArns` configuration parameter to scope execution role Bedrock model invocation permissions to specific model ARNs for least-privilege access
- **Built-in log data protection**: customer-managed KMS encryption and CloudWatch Data Protection PII masking are now always applied to the service-created runtime log groups on every deployment. A built-in comprehensive set of PII identifiers (email addresses, credit card numbers, SSNs, names, addresses, US phone numbers, IP addresses) is always masked. **Upgrade impact**: existing deployments will gain a new KMS key, a Data Protection policy, and a log-protection custom resource on next deploy.
- Added optional `dataProtection.additionalIdentifiers` configuration to mask **additional** AWS-managed data identifiers on top of the built-in set. This field is additive only and cannot reduce the built-in masking baseline. (Replaces the previous `dataProtection.enabled`/`dataProtection.identifiers` configuration — protection is no longer opt-in and the identifier list can no longer be narrowed.)
- Added optional `logRetentionDays` configuration to set CloudWatch Logs retention on the runtime log groups (defaults to 30 days)

### Bug Fixes

#### Generative AI Accelerator v2 Module

- Enforced REST API throttling and abuse protection in response to a pentest finding (single authenticated client could sustain 400+ rps with no throttling). Defense-in-depth across API Gateway and WAF:
  - Added `restApi.apiGwThrottlingBurstLimit` and `restApi.methodThrottling` configuration for stage burst caps and per-method throttle overrides. The stage rate-limit code default is unchanged (2500 rps) to avoid breaking existing deployments; the GAIA v2 sample configs now set an explicit 100 rps / 200 burst ceiling.
  - WAF rate-based protection is now **enabled by default** (previously opt-in and, due to a wiring gap, never applied even when configured). A per-IP rate-based rule plus a per-user rule keyed on the `authorization` header (REGIONAL scope) are created unless disabled via `waf.rateLimit.enabled: false`.
  - Added `restApi.alarms.throttle429` (metric-filter-backed 429 count alarm) and `restApi.alarms.lambdaConcurrency` (Lambda concurrent-execution saturation alarm).
- **Breaking:** WAF rate-based rules are now evaluated **before** the IP allowlist rule so abusive allowlisted traffic is still throttled. This moves the built-in `ipAllow` rule from priority 0 to priority 2 and reserves priorities 0 (per-IP rate), 1 (per-user rate), and 2 (IP allowlist). Any `waf.wafRules` configured with priorities 0–2 must be renumbered to 3 or higher (10+ recommended); a synth-time error is raised on collision. The GAIA v2 sample configs renumber their managed rules to 10–15.
- Made REST API pagination tokens (`next_token`) opaque and versioned. The admin sessions, admin feedback, and user feedback-history endpoints previously returned the raw DynamoDB pagination key (base64-encoded or plain), exposing internal table structure and allowing client-side tampering. Tokens are now KMS-encrypted, integrity-protected, and bound to their issuing endpoint (and user, where applicable); tampered or mismatched tokens are rejected with `400 Invalid next_token`

#### DataOps Project Module

- Fixed cross-account Lake Formation resource links: when `lakeFormation.createCrossAccountResourceLinkAccounts` listed multiple accounts, only the last account received a resource link and DESCRIBE grant. Each account now receives its own link. Resource-link database logical IDs are unchanged, so existing single-account deployments are unaffected and adding an account no longer deletes prior accounts' links.

#### DataZone/SMUS Modules

- Added `kms:GenerateDataKey` permission to the domain config custom resource handler policy, fixing cross-account `ListDomainUnitsForParent`, adapting to SMUS service changes

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-22

#### Generative AI Accelerator v2 Module

- New `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2` app and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2-l3-construct` providing an authenticated GenAI chatbot platform; successor to `@aws-mdaa/gaia`
- AppSync Events API for real-time bidirectional streaming, fronted by Cognito User Pool authentication with optional external OIDC (e.g., Entra ID)
- Pluggable data source model — exactly one of Bedrock Knowledge Base RAG, direct Bedrock model invocation with streaming, or customer-provided Lambda
- Optional client and admin CloudFront UIs with custom-domain and ACM certificate support
- Chat history, feedback, and service-interruption banner backed by KMS-encrypted DynamoDB tables
- WAF protection (regional and global), VPC-attached Lambda execution, and synth-time validation of misconfigurations

#### SageMaker Ground Truth Module

- New `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-ground-truth` app for automated, continuous data labeling pipelines
- EventBridge + SQS + Step Functions architecture for continuous S3 ingestion to batched labeling jobs
- SageMaker Feature Group integration for persisting labeled data
- Optional verification labeling job with automatic re-queue of rejected items
- Configurable EventBridge Scheduler triggers, DLQ with CloudWatch alarms

#### SageMaker MLOps Module

- New `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-mlops` app for training, deployment, batch inference, and monitoring pipelines
- New `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-endpoint` app for deploying SageMaker model endpoints
- Generic `buildPolicies` configuration for attaching custom IAM policies (managed policy ARNs or inline policy documents) to CodeBuild pipeline roles, with optional CDK Nag suppressions
- Registry authentication for CodeArtifact, Artifactory, GitLab, etc. is now handled entirely in user buildspecs
- Optional CodeArtifact integration alongside public npm support

#### SageMaker L2 Constructs

- Added `MdaaSageMakerProjectTemplate`, `MdaaGroundTruth`, and `MdaaModelMonitor` for ML lifecycle management

### Data Science/AI/ML Changes

#### Data Science Team Module

- Added optional MLflow tracking server configuration to the team's SageMaker Studio domain for experiment tracking
- Added per-user JupyterLab space provisioning via the new `jupyterLab` configuration

#### Bedrock AgentCore Runtime Module

- Added `enableTransactionSearch` configuration parameter to optionally skip X-Ray Transaction Search Config creation when the resource already exists
- Added `protocolConfiguration` configuration parameter for runtime protocol selection
- Removed unneeded resource policy from the runtime construct

#### RDS Constructs

- `MdaaAuroraPgVector`: engine version is now configurable via the `engineVersion` prop (default `16.6`). The default is provided for backward compatibility but is not maintained long-term — explicitly set the engine version to avoid future breakage
- `MdaaRdsServerlessCluster`: reader instance count is now configurable via the `numberOfReaderInstances` prop (default `1`)
- `BedrockKnowledgeBase` L3 construct: `engineVersion` from vector store config is now passed through to the Aurora PgVector cluster

### DataOps Module Changes

#### Data Quality Module

- Added multi-source support for rulesets — each ruleset can specify Glue, S3, or Redshift as its data source via a `source` block, with metadata published to SSM for downstream DQ evaluation jobs
- Added recommendation-based rulesets via `recommendationRunId`, delegating rule generation to Glue DQ recommendations
- Added dynamic target discovery via `dynamicTargets` for runtime dataset enumeration by DQ evaluation jobs
- Added `smusPublishing` configuration for publishing data quality metrics to SageMaker Unified Studio (DataZone)
- Added `smusAssetId` per-ruleset field for mapping DQ results to DataZone assets

#### DataOps Job Module

- Added pre-built data quality evaluation scripts (`dq-main.py`, `dq_config.py`, `smus.py`) enabling deployment of a working DQ evaluation Glue job without writing any code

#### DMS Constructs

- Added `expectedBucketOwner` support to S3 endpoint settings for cross-account bucket protection

### Data Lake Changes

- Added optional S3 Storage Lens support — enable via `storageLensEnabled`
- Added optional CORS support — configure via `corsRules`

### Data Analytics Changes

#### Data Warehouse Module

- Added `multiAz` (multi-AZ high availability) and `backupRegion` (cross-region snapshot copy) configuration options
- Added `publicAccessBlockManagedExternally` option to skip the explicit `BlockPublicAccess` setting on S3 buckets; settable globally via CDK context (`@aws-mdaa/publicAccessBlockManagedExternally: true`) or as a per-module property
- Fixed type for `parameterGroupParams` configuration

### Governance Module Changes

#### DataZone/SMUS Modules

- Added simplified `authorizations` interface for domain and domain unit configuration, supporting `projectCreators`, `eligibleProjectMembers`, `domainUnitCreators`, `glossaryCreators`, and `environmentCreators` as a concise alternative to full `authorizationPolicies` objects
- `authorizationPolicies` and `authorizations` are now supported at the root domain level (`BaseDomainProps`), not just on individual domain units
- Domain owners (users, groups, and associated account CDK users) now automatically receive version-aware project creation authorization policies in addition to `ADD_TO_PROJECT_MEMBER_POOL`
- Deprecated `allowAllUsers`, `allowedUsers`, and `allowedGroups` on domain units in favor of `authorizations.eligibleProjectMembers` or `authorizationPolicies`. Switching from these deprecated properties requires a two-step migration: first remove the deprecated properties and deploy, then add the new configuration and redeploy. A single-step migration will produce `PolicyGrant` conflicts.

#### Account-Level Modules

- Glue Catalog, LakeFormation Settings, Macie Session, and QuickSight Account modules now create a static SSM parameter (`/account-module-lock/<module-name>`) that prevents multiple deployments of the same module to a single AWS account

#### Roles Module

- Added optional `additionalTrustedActions` for the role primary principal, allowing extra actions like `sts:TagSession` to be added to the trust policy

### Utility Module Changes

#### CLI

- Added optional permission boundary name input to apply an IAM policy as permission boundary to all IAM roles

### Deprecations

- `@aws-mdaa/gaia` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-l3-construct` (GAIA v1) are deprecated in favor of `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2` and `@aws-mdaa/gaia-v2-l3-construct`
  - v1 packages remain published and functional for existing deployments but will not receive new features
  - v1 packages will be removed in a future major release
  - v2 is a re-architected GAIA backend (Cognito, AppSync Events, CloudFront) and is not a drop-in replacement. See [MIGRATION_TO_V2.md](packages/apps/ai/gaia-app/MIGRATION_TO_V2.md) for guidance

### General Changes

- Every app module now includes `sample-config-minimal.yaml` and `sample-config-comprehensive.yaml` with full schema coverage, inline documentation, and template variables for portability
- All app module READMEs follow a consistent structure with architecture overview, configuration reference, and ordered sample config sections
- Replaced Jest snapshot and synth tests with CDK diff-based baseline testing across all app modules, using the CDK toolkit's semantic diff engine to detect resource changes
- Updated dependencies to address CVEs (`pyjwt`, `ts-jest`, `lodash`, `ajv`, and others)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed IAM Policy cross-stack collision in `dataops-job` and `sm-studio-domain` caused by `BucketDeployment` adding inline policies to imported roles
- Fixed construct ID collision when multiple security groups are defined in a DataOps project
- Fixed model deploy stage IAM policy size overflow in SageMaker MLOps by separating account role responsibilities
- Fixed `MdaaSqsQueue` mis-spelled `encyption` property that prevented the explicit KMS encryption mode from being applied
- Fixed missing ECR permissions in Bedrock AgentCore Runtime when `containerUri` configuration parameter is used
- Fixed SageMaker AI Domain updates failing with "resource already exists" when only mutable settings (default user settings, domain settings) change. Note: changing immutable properties (`AuthMode`, `DomainName`, `KmsKeyId`, `VpcId`) still requires manual domain recreation
- Fixed 403 `PROJECT_CREATE_FAILED` error in same-account DataZone deployments by granting `CREATE_PROJECT` / `CREATE_PROJECT_FROM_PROJECT_PROFILE` and `ADD_TO_PROJECT_MEMBER_POOL` authorization policies to the cfn-exec role and data-admin role on the root domain unit
- Fixed DataZone SageMaker domain child stack not inheriting parent account and region, which caused failures in cross-account deployments
- Fixed DataZone environment naming to use the naming helper with `maxLength` enforcement
- Fixed unique-environment generation in SageMaker projects when the user supplies tooling
- Fixed Lambda Alias `CurrentVersion` no longer being incorrectly flagged by CDK diff baseline testing
- Fixed SageMaker endpoint construct using a non-fixed model name to avoid update conflicts
