"""
Shared thread lifecycle management for review agents.

Handles the common pattern: post summary, create/update/skip detail threads,
auto-resolve orphans, check for unresolved threads, and exit non-zero if blocked.

Each agent provides its own marker pattern, thread formatter, and failure message.
This module handles the GitLab API interactions and lifecycle logic.
