# MLOps Platform Starter Kit

End-to-end ML lifecycle platform covering model training, deployment, and monitoring — deployed and governed through MDAA with CDK Nag compliance (AWS Solutions, NIST 800-53, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).

> **[Deployment Instructions](#deployment)**

## Use Cases

- Automated ML model training pipelines with versioned model registry
- Multi-stage model deployment (dev → pre-prod → prod) with manual approval gates
- Real-time inference endpoints with model quality monitoring
- CI/CD for ML with CodePipeline and CodeBuild
- Cross-account model deployment for environment isolation
- Network-isolated training and inference for compliance

## Capabilities

- Unified training + deployment CI/CD pipelines via `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-mlops`
- SageMaker Pipeline (preprocess → train → register) with automatic execution
- SageMaker Endpoint with model quality monitoring schedule
- Model Package Group for versioned model registry
- EventBridge-triggered deployment on model approval
- KMS-encrypted S3 bucket for model artifacts
- CodeCommit repositories seeded with ML scripts and MDAA configs
- Optional cross-account deployment (dev → pre-prod → prod)

## Deployment

### Prerequisites and Predeployment

1. Authenticate to your target AWS account and region. Ensure the authenticated role has permissions to deploy resources via CDK.
2. [Bootstrap CDK](../../PREDEPLOYMENT.md#single-account-bootstrap) in your target account and region. For cross-account deployment, also [bootstrap target accounts with trust](../../PREDEPLOYMENT.md#multi-account-bootstrap).
3. Provision a VPC with at least 2 private subnets and security groups. Subnets must have connectivity to AWS service endpoints, either via:
   - NAT Gateway for outbound internet access, OR
   - VPC Endpoints for:
     - Gateway: `com.amazonaws.<region>.s3`
     - Interface: `com.amazonaws.<region>.sagemaker.api`
     - Interface: `com.amazonaws.<region>.sagemaker.runtime`
     - Interface: `com.amazonaws.<region>.sts`
     - Interface: `com.amazonaws.<region>.logs`

4. Download the sample Abalone training dataset into the `data/` directory:
   ```bash
   curl -o data/abalone-dataset.csv \
     https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data
   ```

### Configure MDAA

1. Address all TODOs in [`mdaa.yaml`](mdaa.yaml), specifically:
   - Set `organization` to a globally unique name
   - Set `context` values:
     - `sagemaker_project_name` — identifier for your ML project
     - `vpc_id` — VPC ID
     - `subnet_ids` — list of private subnet IDs
     - `security_group_ids` — list of security group IDs

2. (Optional) If using cross-account deployment, configure `preProdEnvironment` and `prodEnvironment` in [`mlops/mlops.yaml`](mlops/mlops.yaml).

3. (Optional) Review CDK Nag suppressions in [`mlops/mlops.yaml`](mlops/mlops.yaml). Uncomment each suppression only after reviewing the associated permissions and confirming they are acceptable for your environment.

### Deploy MDAA

Run the following from the starter kit directory (containing `mdaa.yaml`):

1. Optionally, run `npx @aws-mdaa/cli ls` to understand what stacks will be deployed.

2. Optionally, run `npx @aws-mdaa/cli synth` and review the produced templates.

3. Run `npx @aws-mdaa/cli deploy` to deploy all modules.

## Next Steps

See [USAGE](USAGE.md) for post-deployment instructions.

## Modules Deployed

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-mlops` | Unified training + deploy CI/CD pipelines |
| `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-pipeline` | SageMaker Pipeline (deployed by seed code) |
| `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-endpoint` | SageMaker Endpoint (deployed by seed code) |
| `@aws-mdaa/sagemaker-model-monitoring` | Model quality monitoring (deployed by seed code) |

## Troubleshooting

1. **Training pipeline fails with network errors**: Verify VPC subnets have routes to a NAT Gateway or the required VPC Endpoints (S3, SageMaker API, SageMaker Runtime, STS, CloudWatch Logs).

2. **Model not triggering deploy pipeline**: EventBridge triggers on model package status change to "Approved". Verify the model was registered with `ModelApprovalStatus: Approved` in the model package group.

3. **Endpoint deployment fails in cross-account**: Ensure the target account is CDK bootstrapped with `--trust` referencing the deployment account, and that the model artifact bucket grants cross-account read access.

4. **Seed code changes not taking effect**: Seed code is pushed to CodeCommit only on initial deploy. Push updates manually via `aws codecommit put-file` or clone and push to the repository.
