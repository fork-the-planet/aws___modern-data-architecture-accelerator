## Design Philosophy

MDAA is built on two core principles that guide every contribution:

**Compliance by default.** Security and regulatory compliance are not optional add-ons — they are baked into every construct. L2 constructs enforce encryption, access controls, and logging out of the box. CDK Nag validates against NIST 800-53, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and AWS Solutions rulesets automatically. Contributors should never require users to opt in to secure behavior; instead, secure is the default and escape hatches are explicit and auditable.

**User experience first.** MDAA users are data engineers and platform teams, not CDK experts. Module configurations should be simple YAML with sensible defaults that produce production-ready infrastructure. Complex tuning options should be available but never required. When designing a new feature, start with the sample config a user would write, not the CDK code — if the config isn't intuitive, the implementation doesn't matter. See the [Development Approach](DEVELOPMENT.md#development-approach) for how this translates into practice.

## Ways to Contribute

For all contribution types, **start by opening a GitHub issue** so the core team can review and approve the change before you begin work.

- **Bug Reports** — Found something that doesn't work as expected? Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/aws/modern-data-architecture-accelerator/issues/new) with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
- **Feature Requests** — Have an idea for a new capability or improvement? Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/aws/modern-data-architecture-accelerator/issues/new) describing the use case and expected behavior.
- **Documentation Improvements** — Spotted a typo, unclear instruction, or missing information? For small fixes like typos, submit a PR directly. For larger documentation changes, open an issue first to discuss the scope.
- **Code Contributions** — Fix bugs, add features, or improve existing modules. Open an issue first, then see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) to get started once approved.
- **Sample Configuration Contributions** — Build new sample configurations for common use cases and contribute the same to the [sample configurations repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-config-modern-data-architecture-accelerator).

When filing an issue, please check existing open or recently closed issues to avoid duplicates. Include as much detail as you can:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The version of MDAA you're using
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the issue
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Getting Started

- [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) — Environment setup, build commands, coding guidelines, and scripts
- [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) — Testing strategy, coverage requirements, and CI pipeline


## AI-Assisted Development

This repository includes pre-configured AI steering rules for multiple development tools. On first checkout, your IDE's AI assistant automatically picks up project-specific guidance — no setup required.

**Supported tools:**

| Tool | Rules location |
|---|---|
| [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) | `.kiro/steering/` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/rules/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` + `.github/instructions/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/` |

Rules activate automatically based on the files you're working with (e.g., config-authoring rules load when editing yaml files, testing-standards load when editing test files).

**Available rules:**

| Rule | What It Covers |
|---|---|
| `config-authoring` | MDAA config editing: dynamic references, role refs, schema lookup, module discovery |
| `coding-standards` | Config schema JSDoc auditing and improvement |
| `compliance-review` | Compliance controls, CDK Nag validation, nag suppression documentation |
| `testing-standards` | Testing strategy, diff baselines, coverage requirements, Python test patterns |
| `diff-risk-assessment` | Baseline diffs: breaking changes, data loss risks, construct ID scoping |
| `module-quality` | Module README documentation and sample config schema coverage |
| `module-creation` | Scaffolding new app modules and constructs |
| `code-documentation` | Code documentation standards for all MDAA code |
| `scripts-authoring` | Standards for scripts under `scripts/` |

In Kiro, reference a rule by name (e.g., `#module-quality`) to activate it manually. Other tools activate rules automatically based on file patterns.

## Sample Configuration Standards

Every app module under `packages/apps/` must include sample configuration files that demonstrate the module's capabilities and exercise its config schema. Sample configs serve as both test fixtures and user-facing reference examples.

### File Naming

- `sample-config-minimal.yaml` — simplest valid deployment that creates the module's core resource
- `sample-config-comprehensive.yaml` — exercises every compatible, non-excluded schema property at full depth
- `sample-config-{variant}.yaml` — for mutually exclusive configuration branches (e.g., `sample-config-noproject.yaml`)
- Names like `advanced-config.yaml`, `basic-config.yaml`, or `sample-config.yaml` (without suffix) are not allowed

### Coverage Rules

- **Comprehensive** = 100% coverage of compatible properties. If a property exists in the schema, is not excluded, and is not mutually exclusive with the config's choices, it must be present.
- **Minimal** = only required properties, plus enough to deploy the module's core resource. A minimal config that only deploys supporting infrastructure (KMS keys, IAM roles) without the module's namesake resource is a bug.
- Every enum value must be exercised across the set of sample configs.
- Mutually exclusive schema branches (`oneOf`/`anyOf`) each need their own sample config file.

### Template Variables

Never hardcode AWS account IDs, regions, or partitions in sample configs:

- `{{account}}` for the deployment account, `{{context:account-2}}` / `{{context:account-3}}` for cross-account references
- `{{region}}` for region segments
- `arn:{{partition}}:` for ARN prefixes (never `arn:aws:`)
- Single-quote template variables when they are the entire YAML value: `account: '{{context:account-2}}'`
- No spaces inside braces: `{{region}}` not `{{ region }}`

### Inline Documentation

Every property in a sample config must have a preceding comment derived from the schema's `description` field:

- Optional properties get a `# (Optional)` prefix; required is implied
- Append enum values: `(enum: gp2, gp3, io1, io2)`
- Append defaults: `(default: value)`
- Wrap at 100 characters across multiple `#` lines
- Each sample config starts with a header comment describing the module and what the config demonstrates

### Role References

- Prefer `name:` or `arn:` over `id:` — only use `id:` in datalake-app as a reference example
- `generated-role-id:` and `ssm:` prefixed values are acceptable everywhere
- Add `# See CONFIGURATION.md for role reference options (name, arn, id).` once per file above the first role reference

### Cross-Module Resource References

When a config value references a resource from another module or external infrastructure, add a two-line comment:

```yaml
# VPC ID for cluster deployment
# Often created by your VPC/networking stack.
# Example SSM: ssm:/path/to/vpc/id
vpcId: vpc-testvpc
```

### Test Requirements

Every sample config file must have corresponding:

- **Diff baseline test** — `baselineDiffTestApp` call in `{module}.diff.test.ts`
- **Synth test** — validates the config synthesizes without errors
- **Snapshot test** — `snapShotTestApp` with `Create.appProvider` (not `snapShotTest`)

### README Integration

Every sample config must be referenced in the module's README under `### Module Config Samples and Variants`, ordered: minimal → comprehensive → variants. Each config gets:

1. An `####` heading describing the variant
2. A 1-2 sentence user-facing description with a use case sentence
3. A markdown link to the file
4. A fenced code block with MkDocs snippet include

Use user-facing language in descriptions — not "exercises every property" but "covers all available options."

> **Kiro:** The `module-quality` steering file automates the entire process — schema analysis, gap identification, sample config generation, test creation, and README updates. Use it to bring a module to full coverage in a single session.

## Module Documentation Standards

Every app module must have a README.md following a consistent structure. These READMEs serve as both developer documentation and the source for the generated MkDocs site.

### Required README Structure

1. **Title + description** — Module name as H1, followed by a paragraph explaining what the module deploys and why. End with a usage scenario sentence.
2. **Deployed Resources** — `**Resource Name** - description` format. Descriptions must be factual (what it is, what it does). No compliance language here.
3. **Architecture diagram** — `![...]()` reference to L3 construct docs image
4. **Related Modules** — Linked list with relationship descriptions explaining how modules connect. Placed after Deployed Resources.
5. **Security/Compliance Details** — Standard intro paragraph, then categorized sub-bullets: Encryption at Rest, Encryption in Transit, Least Privilege, Separation of Duties, Network Isolation, etc.
6. **Configuration > MDAA Config** — `mdaa.yaml` wiring snippet
7. **Configuration > Module Config Samples and Variants** — Sample configs with dual-include pattern (see [Sample Configuration Standards](#sample-configuration-standards))

### Key Rules

- Compliance language (encryption enforcement, access grants, security group defaults) belongs in Security/Compliance, not Deployed Resources
- Use `**Bold Name** - description` format for resources, not bullet lists with colons
- Related Modules use relative paths and explain the relationship, not just "Related module"
- Never refer to modules as "CDK applications" — they are configurable modules

> **Kiro:** The `module-quality` steering file also automates README auditing and improvement across all modules — it checks structure, content quality, link integrity, and sample config references, then implements fixes.

## Developing Modules

Whether adding a new module or enhancing an existing one, MDAA follows a "working backwards" approach — start from the user's configuration experience, then work inward to the constructs that implement it. See the [Development Approach](DEVELOPMENT.md#development-approach) for the full process.

> **Kiro:** The `module-creation` steering file automates scaffolding new app modules and constructs with proper skeleton packages, configuration files, test scaffolding, and documentation templates.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Open a GitHub issue first** and wait for approval from the MDAA core team before starting work.
2. **Create a branch** from `main` for your changes. Use a descriptive branch name with a conventional prefix: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, or `chore/` (e.g., `feat/add-redshift-module`, `fix/s3-encryption-bug`).
3. **Make your changes**, focusing on a single concern per PR. If you also reformat unrelated code, it will be harder to review your contribution.
4. **Run all checks** to make sure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   npm run prepush
   ```
   Or for a thorough check with no cache:
   ```bash
   npm run prepush:all
   ```
5. **Commit with clear messages** describing what changed and why.
6. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch, referencing the approved issue in the PR description.
7. **Respond to review feedback** and address any automated CI failures. Automated checks run on all pull requests — ensure the CI pipeline passes before requesting review.
