# Configuration

Once a platform architecture is defined, the next step is to translate the architecture into MDAA configuration files.

## MDAA Configuration Structure

MDAA is designed to deploy data environments across multiple domains and environments. Each domain/environment is constituted by one or more configured MDAA modules. Each MDAA module references a CDK app and corresponding configuration. During deployment, MDAA executes a module's underlying CDK application, providing all necessary configuration details as CDK context.

- **Domain** - A data environment can be organized into one or more _domains_, which may align to organizational units such as line of business, directorate, etc. Domains may be spread across one or more accounts. When spread across multiple accounts, each domain becomes a potential node in a data mesh architecture.
- **Environment** - A domain can be deployed across multiple _environments_ (such as DEV/TEST/PROD). Each environment may be deployed in a separate account.
- **Module** - A _module_ specifies which CDK App and corresponding configuration will be deployed within a data environment domain/environment. During deployment, modules will be deployed in stages according to dependencies between modules.
- **CDK App** - A _CDK App_ is built, executed, and deployed using the AWS CDK framework. The CDK app will be forked from the MDAA orchestrator and executed as a regular CDK application. Each CDK produces one or more CloudFormation stacks, which in turn deploy the cloud resources which will constitute the data environment. Alternatively, instead of deploying resources directly to the environment, they can instead be published as Service Catalog products, to be deployed on a self-service basis by users within the accounts.

## MDAA Config File/Folder Layouts

MDAA is configured using a set of YAML configuration files. The main CLI configuration file (typically 'mdaa.yaml') specifies the global, domain, environment, and modules to be deployed. Module (CDK App) configurations are specified in separate YAML files, or can be configured inline in the CLI config itself. Module (CDK App) configurations are documented in detail in their respective READMEs. Terraform modules are configured directly using HCL configurations next to mdaa.yaml.

MDAA configuration layouts are very flexible. Configurations for an entire org can be concentrated into a single MDAA config file, or can be spread out across multiple config files by domain, line of business, environment, etc.

### Single Domain, Shared CDK Apps Configs Across Envs

In this scenario, a MDAA config contains a single domain, with CDK App configs shared across dev/test/prod. In this case, the shared configs likely make heavy use of SSM parameters to achieve portability across environments.

```text
root_folder
│   mdaa.yaml
│   tags.yaml
│
└───domain1
   │   roles.yaml
   │   datalake.yaml
```

### Single Domain, Separate CDK Apps Configs Across Envs

In this scenario, a MDAA config contains a single domain, with separate CDK App configs across dev/test/prod.

```text
root_folder
│   mdaa.yaml
│   tags.yaml
│
└───domain1
    └───dev
    │   │   dev_roles.yaml
    │   │   dev_datalake.yaml
    │
    └───test
    │   │   test_roles.yaml
    │   │   test_datalake.yaml
    │
    └───prod
        │   prod_roles.yaml
        │   prod_datalake.yaml
```

### Multiple domains, single MDAA config

In this scenario, multiple domains are in the same MDAA config.

```text
root_folder
│   mdaa.yaml
│   tags.yaml
│
└───domain1
│   │   roles.yaml
│   │   datalake.yaml
│
└───domain2
    │   roles.yaml
    │   datalake.yaml
    │   ...
```

### Multiple domains, Multiple MDAA config

In this scenario, each domain is in its own MDAA config.

```text
root_folder1
│   mdaa.yaml
│   tags.yaml
│
└───domain1
   │   roles.yaml
   │   datalake.yaml

root_folder2
│   mdaa.yaml
│   tags.yaml
│
└───domain2
    │   roles.yaml
    │   datalake.yaml
    │   ...
```

          - echo testing
        pre:
          - echo testing
        post:
          - echo testing
      postDeployValidate:
        install:
          - echo testing
        commands:
          - echo testing
```

### Sample Tag Configurations

```yaml
tags:
  costcentre: '195040010'
  project: datalake
  system-data-classification: PROTECTEDB
```

## Module Configurations

Each MDAA Module/CDK App has its own configuration schema, which is documented in their respective READMEs. There are some common configuration behaviours and capabilities, however, which can be used across all MDAA Module configs.

### Role References

Many MDAA modules require IAM role references for granting access to resources like KMS keys, S3 buckets, SageMaker domains, and Lake Formation permissions. These are specified using the `MdaaRoleRef` format, which supports several resolution strategies.

#### Reference Styles

```yaml
# By name — simplest approach, recommended for most cases.
# MDAA automatically expands the name to a full ARN in the
# deployment account.
- name: Admin

# By ARN — use when you need to reference a role in a specific
# account, or when the role ARN is stored in an SSM parameter.
- arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Admin
- arn: ssm:/my-org/shared/roles/admin/arn

# By role ID — the AWS-generated unique identifier (e.g. AROA...).
# Use when stable, immutable references are a security requirement,
# since role names and ARNs can be reassigned to different roles.
- id: AROA1234567890EXAMPLE
- id: ssm:/my-org/shared/roles/admin/id

# By MDAA generated role shorthand — resolves the role ID from
# SSM parameters created by the MDAA Roles module.
- id: generated-role-id:my-role-name
```

#### How Resolution Works

When MDAA processes a role reference:

1. `name:` is expanded to a full IAM role ARN using the deployment account ID
2. `arn:` is used as-is (or resolved from SSM if prefixed with `ssm:`)
3. `id:` is used as-is (or resolved from SSM / generated-role-id shorthand)

Some modules (like Data Lake and Lake Formation) further resolve ARN references to role IDs at deploy time via a custom resource. This ensures that bucket policies and Lake Formation grants reference the immutable role ID rather than the role name, which provides stronger security guarantees.

#### Optional Flags

```yaml
# Mark a role as immutable — MDAA will not attach managed policies
# to this role. Use for roles managed outside of MDAA (e.g. SSO
# permission set roles) where policy attachment is not permitted.
- name: AWSReservedSSO_DataScientist_abcdef
  immutable: true

# Mark a role as SSO-managed — resolves the auto-generated IAM
# role name created by IAM Identity Center for the given
# permission set.
- name: DataScientistPermissionSet
  sso: true
```

#### Choosing a Reference Style

| Style                | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name:`              | Default choice. Simple, readable, works for same-account roles.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `arn:`               | Cross-account roles, or when the ARN is stored in SSM for portability.                                                                                                                                           |
| `id:`                | When your security policy requires stable references that survive role recreation. Role IDs are immutable — if a role is deleted and recreated with the same name, the ID changes, preventing unintended access. |
| `generated-role-id:` | Referencing roles created by the MDAA Roles module. Resolves the role ID from SSM parameters automatically.                                                                                                      |

#### Example

```yaml
# Data Lake module — demonstrates all reference styles
roles:
  DataAdmin:
    - arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Admin
  DataUser:
    - name: data-scientist
    - id: generated-role-id:etl-role
  DataEngineer:
    - name: AWSReservedSSO_Engineer_abcdef
      immutable: true
```

See the [Data Lake sample configs](packages/apps/datalake/datalake-app/sample_configs/) for a complete example demonstrating all role reference styles.

### Dynamic References

MDAA allows use of Dynamic References in configuration files. These build on the concept of CloudFormation Dynamic References.

```yaml
# Example Config File w/Dynamic References

# Will be passed through to CloudFormation as a CFN Dynamic Reference and will be resolved at deployment time
vpcId: "{{resolve:ssm:/path/to/ssm/param}}"
sensitive_value: "{{resolve:ssm-secure:parameter-name:version}}"
db_username: "{{resolve:secretsmanager:MyRDSSecret:SecretString:username}}",
db_password: "{{resolve:secretsmanager:MyRDSSecret:SecretString:password}}"

# Will be resolved at synth time to the CDK context value passed from the MDAA CLI config or directly in CDK context
subnetId: "{{context:some_context_key}}"

# Will be resolved at synth time to environment variable values
subnetId: "{{env_var:some_env_variable_name}}"

# Will be resolved at synth time to the values passed for org/domain/env/account/region from the MDAA CLI config via CDK context
# Identical to org: "{{context:org}}"
org: "{{org}}"
domain: "{{domain}}"
env: "{{env}}"
module_name: "{{module_name}}"
partition: "{{partition}}"
account: "{{account}}"
region: "{{region}}"

# Dynamic references can also be embedded inline in config values:
key_arn: arn:{{partition}}:kms:{{region}}:{{account}}:key/{{context:key_id}}
```

### SSM Parameter References

Most MDAA Config properties allow referencing SSM parameters instead of directly specifying config values. This is useful for configuring an MDAA module to use resources from another MDAA module, or external resources created outside of MDAA.

```yaml
# Full SSM path
config_key: ssm:/path/to/ssm/param

# Org SSM path - automatically prepends SSM path with standard MDAA org path.
# This is shorthand for referencing SSM parameters created by MDAA within the same org.
# This expands to ssm:/{{org}}/other_domain/other_module/some_path
config_key: ssm-org:/other_domain/other_module/some_path

# Domain SSM path - automatically prepends SSM path with standard MDAA org/domain path.
# This is shorthand for referencing SSM parameters created by MDAA within the same org and domain.
# This expands to ssm:/{{org}}/{{domain}}/other_module/some_path
config_key: ssm-domain:/other_module/some_path
```

### Configuration Sharing Across Domains, Envs, Modules

MDAA modules may share identical config files across multiple domains, envs, and modules. Because MDAA automatically injects the domain/env/module names into resource naming, each resulting deployment will result in uniquely named resources but with otherwise identical behaviours.

```yaml
# Example MDAA Config With Shared Configs
domains:
  domain1:
    environments:
      dev:
        modules:
          test_datalake:
            module_path: '@aws-mdaa/datalake'
            module_configs:
              - ./shared/datalake.yaml
  domain2:
    environments:
      dev:
        modules:
          test_datalake:
            module_path: '@aws-mdaa/datalake'
            module_configs:
              - ./shared/datalake.yaml
```

Both datalakes will have identical configurations, but named according to their domain.

### Configuration Composition

Each MDAA module accepts one or more configuration files, which are merged into an effective config, which is then validated and parsed by the app. This allows for configs to be composed of common base configs shared across multiple modules, environments, or domains, with only the differentiating config values to be applied on top.

In general, config files will be merged according to the following rules:

- Lists on same config key will be merged across config files
- Objects on same config key will be concatenated
- Scalar values will be overridden, with config files higher on list taking precedence

```yaml
# Example MDAA CLI Module Specification With Multiple Configs
domains:
  domain1:
    environments:
      dev:
        modules:
          roles1:
            module_path: '@aws-mdaa/roles'
            module_configs:
              - ./domain1/roles1.yaml
              - ./shared/roles_base.yaml
  domain2:
    environments:
      dev:
        modules:
          roles2:
            module_path: '@aws-mdaa/roles'
            module_configs:
              - ./domain2/roles2.yaml
              - ./shared/roles_base.yaml
```

```yaml
# ./shared/roles_base.yaml

generateRoles:
  - name: common-role
    ...

```

```yaml
# ./domain1/roles1.yaml

generateRoles:
  - name: role1
    ...

```

```yaml
# ./domain2/roles2.yaml

generateRoles:
  - name: role2
    ...

```

```yaml
# Effective config for Domain1/Roles1
generateRoles:
  - name: common-role
    ...
  - name: role1
    ...
```

## Module Hooks

MDAA supports predeploy and postdeploy hooks that allow you to execute custom commands before and after module deployment. This is useful for tasks like data preparation, validation, cleanup, or integration with external systems.

### Hook Configuration

Hooks are configured at the module level in your MDAA configuration:

```yaml
domains:
  shared:
    environments:
      dev:
        modules:
          datalake:
            module_path: '@aws-mdaa/datalake'
            module_configs:
              - ./datalake.yaml
            # Predeploy hook - runs before module deployment
            predeploy:
              command: './scripts/prepare-data.sh'
              exit_if_fail: true
            # Postdeploy hook - runs after module deployment
            postdeploy:
              command: './scripts/validate-deployment.sh'
              exit_if_fail: false
              after_success: true
```

### Hook Properties

#### `command` (required)

The command to execute. This can be:

- A shell script: `"./scripts/setup.sh"`
- A direct command: `"aws s3 cp data.csv s3://my-bucket/"`
- A complex command: `"npm run build && npm run test"`

You can provide template variables as arguments to the script: `{{org}}`, `{{domain}}`, `{{env}}`, `{{module_name}}`, `{{region}}`, `{{account}}`, and `{{partition}}`

You can also reference values from the module's effective context using `{{context:<key>}}`, for example `"./scripts/setup.sh {{context:my_group}} {{context:my_region}}"`. These resolve against the same context used elsewhere in the config (see the Context section above).

#### `exit_if_fail` (optional, default: false)

If `true`, the deployment will stop if the hook command fails (exits with non-zero code).
If `false`, the deployment will continue even if the hook fails.

#### `after_success` (optional, default: false, postdeploy only)

For postdeploy hooks only:

- If `true`, the hook only runs if the module deployment was successful
- If `false`, the hook runs regardless of deployment success/failure

### Hook Execution Environment

Hooks execute with the following characteristics:

- **Working Directory**: Commands run in the module's directory
- **Environment Variables**: All environment variables from the MDAA process are inherited, including AWS credentials
- **Output**: Command output appears in real-time during execution
- **Error Reporting**: Enhanced error details are provided when commands fail, including exit codes and file analysis for shell scripts

### Common Use Cases

#### Data Preparation

```yaml
predeploy:
  command: './scripts/upload-sample-data.sh'
  exit_if_fail: true
```

#### Deployment Validation

```yaml
postdeploy:
  command: './scripts/run-integration-tests.sh'
  exit_if_fail: false
  after_success: true
```

#### Cleanup Tasks

```yaml
postdeploy:
  command: './scripts/cleanup-temp-resources.sh'
  exit_if_fail: false
  after_success: false # Run cleanup even if deployment failed
```

#### AWS CLI Operations

```yaml
predeploy:
  command: 'aws s3 sync ./data/ s3://my-data-bucket/input/'
  exit_if_fail: true
```

### Hook Execution Order

For modules with both hooks configured:

1. **Predeploy hook** executes first
2. **Module deployment** (CDK/Terraform commands) executes
3. **Postdeploy hook** executes last (subject to `after_success` setting)

If a predeploy hook fails and `exit_if_fail: true`, the module deployment and postdeploy hook will not execute.

### Best Practices

- **Script Permissions**: Ensure shell scripts are executable (`chmod +x script.sh`)
- **Error Handling**: Use `exit_if_fail: true` for critical setup tasks
- **Idempotency**: Design hooks to be safely re-runnable
- **Logging**: Include appropriate logging in your hook scripts for debugging
- **AWS Credentials**: Hooks automatically inherit AWS credentials from the MDAA process
- **Path References**: Use relative paths from the module directory or absolute paths

## Resource Naming

MDAA provides a default naming implementation which can be overridden through specification of a custom naming module and class in the MDAA configuration. The default naming convention is implemented as follows:

```text
<organization>-<environment>-<domain>-<module>-<function>
```

- **organization** - Corresponds to the Organization deploying MDAA
- **environment** - Corresponds to the MDAA Environment
- **domain** - Corresponds to the MDAA Domain
- **module** - Corresponds to the name of the MDAA module
- **function** - An optional resource function/name (established in the CDK App code)
