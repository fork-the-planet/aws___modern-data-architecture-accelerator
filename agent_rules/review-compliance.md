# Compliance Review - Steering Guide

Review and improve compliance controls, CDK Nag validation, and nag suppression documentation across MDAA constructs and modules. This steering file covers the full scope of MDAA's security and compliance posture.

#[[file:CONTRIBUTING.md]]
#[[file:TESTING.md]]

## Scope

- **L2 constructs**: `packages/constructs/L2/` — compliance defaults (encryption, access controls, logging)
- **L3 constructs**: `packages/constructs/L3/` — compliance controls where L2 constructs don't exist
- **App modules**: `packages/apps/` — compliance inherited from constructs, plus module-level nag suppressions
- **CDK Nag rulesets**: AwsSolutions, NIST 800-53 R5, HIPAA Security, PCI DSS 3.2.1

## Compliance Philosophy

The compliance philosophy and construct patterns are defined in CONTRIBUTING.md (pulled in via `#[[file:CONTRIBUTING.md]]` above). This steering file focuses on the review process and nag suppression improvement workflow.

## What to Review

### Construct Compliance Controls
- Every L2 construct enforces encryption, access controls, and logging appropriate to its resource type
- Every L3 construct validates compliance for resources not covered by existing L2 constructs
- All compliance controls have explicit test assertions (not just coverage)
- CDK Nag compliance is checked in every construct test via `testApp.checkCdkNagCompliance()`

### Nag Suppression Quality
- Every suppression has a documented reason explaining why the rule is suppressed
- Reasons reference specific AWS service authorization documentation
- Suppressions are scoped as narrowly as possible (resource-level, not stack-level)

### Opt-In Compliance Antipattern (Compliance by Default Violations)

MDAA's core design principle is "compliance by default" — security controls must be enforced unconditionally, not gated behind optional configuration properties. Review all conditional blocks (`if (props.x)`, `if (props.x?.enabled)`) that guard security-critical behavior:

- **Encryption**: CMK encryption on log groups, storage, or data at rest must never be optional. If a service creates resources that the construct cannot control at synth time (e.g., service-created log groups), the construct must unconditionally apply encryption after resource creation.
- **Retention policies**: Log retention must be applied by default, not only when a user opts in. Uncontrolled log retention is a compliance and cost risk.
- **Access controls**: Network isolation, IAM boundary enforcement, and resource policies must not be gated behind optional boolean flags unless there is an explicit, documented reason.

**Detection pattern**: Look for optional interface properties (marked with `?`) in construct props where:
1. The property controls whether a security resource (KMS key, log retention, data protection policy, security group) is created
2. The default behavior when the property is omitted results in **no security control being applied**
3. The construct creates or references resources that will exist in an unprotected state when the property is not set

This includes resources created outside the CloudFormation stack (e.g., service-managed log groups, auto-created security groups) that CDK Nag cannot inspect. The fact that CDK Nag passes does not make opt-in encryption acceptable — CDK Nag only validates resources in the template.

**Acceptable patterns**:
- Optional properties that tune the *strength* of a control that is always applied (e.g., choosing between AES-256 and CMK when encryption always happens)
- Optional properties that add *additional* protections on top of a baseline that is already secure (e.g., enabling PII data masking on a log group that is already encrypted)
- Optional boolean flags that *disable* a control with a documented justification (opt-out, not opt-in)

### Security Patterns
- IAM policies use resource-scoped permissions, not `*`
- Large inline IAM policies should be extracted into managed policies — small inline policies are acceptable, but extremely large inline policies (many actions or statements) are harder to maintain, reuse, and audit
- KMS key policies follow the admin/user separation pattern
- Security groups follow least-privilege ingress/egress rules
- Cross-account access uses proper trust relationships

## Improving Nag Suppression Reasons

When improving suppression reasons, follow this structure:

- One sentence per service/action group, each with its own AWS service authorization reference URL inline
- Use glob-style shorthand for action groups where possible (e.g., `datazone:Get*/List*`)
- Keep it concise — no filler words

### Content Rules

- State which actions do not support resource-level permissions
- Link to the specific service authorization reference page: `https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_<servicename>.html`
- If additional scoping exists (conditions like `aws:ViaAWSService`, resource ARN patterns), mention it in the same sentence

### Example

```typescript
reason:
  'datazone:Get*/List* do not support resource-level permissions ' +
  '(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazondatazone.html). ' +
  'iam:GetRole does not support resource-level permissions ' +
  '(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_iam.html) ' +
  'and is further scoped via aws:ViaAWSService condition.',
```

### Process

1. Read the policy statements near the suppression to understand which actions use wildcard resources
2. Look up each service's authorization reference page to confirm resource-level permission support
3. Write one sentence per service with the reference URL
4. Mention any IAM conditions or resource ARN scoping that further limits the wildcard

## Validation

After making compliance changes:

1. Run `npm run test` in the affected package — all CDK Nag compliance tests must pass
2. Run `npm run lint` — no linting errors
3. If nag suppressions were added or modified, verify the reason text follows the structure above
4. If compliance controls were added, verify they have explicit test assertions

## CI Agent Usage

This section is used by the automated Compliance Review CI agent. When invoked by the agent,
Kiro receives the code diff, full source, test files, and dependency tree for a construct package,
and must produce structured JSON findings.

### JSON Output Schema

Write findings to `{output_file}` as a JSON object. No preamble, no markdown fences, no explanation
outside the JSON. The file must contain ONLY valid JSON.

```json
{
  "overall_risk": "BLOCKING | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "summary": "One paragraph explaining the overall compliance posture and key concerns.",
  "findings": [
    {
      "risk": "BLOCKING | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
      "category": "encryption | access_control | nag_suppression | iam_policy | security_group | logging",
      "file": "path/to/file.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "resource": "AWS::S3::Bucket (if applicable)",
      "detail": "What's wrong and what should be done."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Risk Classification for CI Agent

- **BLOCKING:** Missing encryption on stateful resources (S3, DynamoDB, RDS, OpenSearch, EFS), removed security controls that were previously enforced, new resource created without any compliance controls
- **HIGH:** Opt-in compliance antipattern — security controls (encryption, log retention, access controls) gated behind optional config properties where the default is unprotected (violates "compliance by default"); vague nag suppression reasons (no AWS service authorization reference); broad IAM wildcards (`Resource: '*'`) without justification; removed IAM conditions (`aws:SourceArn`, `aws:SourceAccount`). This includes cases where resources exist outside the CloudFormation template (e.g., service-created log groups) and the construct only applies security controls when an optional property is set.
- **MEDIUM:** Nag suppressions with specific but improvable reasons, IAM policies that could be tighter, security group rules that could be narrower, extremely large inline IAM policies that should be refactored into managed policies (small inline policies are acceptable but large ones with many actions/statements hurt maintainability and auditability)
- **LOW:** Minor documentation gaps on suppressions, style issues in suppression reason formatting

### Rules for CI Agent Findings

- One finding per compliance issue. If a resource has multiple concerns, create separate findings.
- Every finding must include `file` and `line` pointing to the construct source where the issue is.
- Only include findings for code that was CHANGED in this MR. Do not flag pre-existing issues.
- Order findings: BLOCKING first, then HIGH, then MEDIUM, then LOW.
- Omit LOW findings if there are BLOCKING or HIGH findings.
- Use only ASCII characters in all string values.
- **Do NOT report missing tests or test coverage gaps.** Testing is handled by the Test Standards agent. Focus exclusively on the compliance posture of the implementation code itself.
- **Actively check for opt-in compliance antipatterns.** When new optional properties are added to construct props interfaces, trace the code path for when those properties are `undefined`/`false`. If the absence of the property results in no encryption, no log retention, no access control, or no security resource being created, flag it as HIGH. Do not assume that CDK Nag passing means the construct is compliant — CDK Nag cannot see resources created outside CloudFormation (service-managed log groups, auto-created resources, etc.).

### Line Number Anchoring (CRITICAL for stability)

Line numbers must be deterministic across runs. **Incorrect line numbers cause duplicate review threads and block the pipeline.** You MUST follow these rules exactly:

**Core rule: always anchor to the first line in the new file immediately after the diff hunk that contains the issue.**

This is the first context line (no `+` or `-` prefix) that follows the last changed line in the hunk. It always exists in the new file and is deterministic regardless of whether the change is an addition, deletion, or modification.

To determine the new-file line number:
1. Read the hunk header `@@ -old_start,old_count +new_start,new_count @@` — the `+new_start` is the new-file line number of the first line in the hunk.
2. Count forward through the hunk: context lines and `+` lines increment the new-file counter. `-` lines do NOT increment it.
3. The first context line after the last `+` or `-` line is your anchor.

**Example:** Given this code diff:
```
@@ -180,16 +180,16 @@ export class MdaaSqsQueue extends Construct {
     // Intentionally broad IAM policy
     const adminStatement = new PolicyStatement({
       sid: 'AdminAccess',
       effect: Effect.ALLOW,
-      actions: ['sqs:*'],
+      actions: ['sqs:SendMessage', 'sqs:ReceiveMessage'],
       resources: ['*'],
     });
```

First line after the hunk's changes: `resources: ['*'],` at new-file line 186.
Correct: `"line": 186`
Wrong: `"line": 182` (the `new PolicyStatement({` — not the first line after)
Wrong: `"line": 185` (the `+` line itself — not a context line)

**Rules:**
- NEVER use old-file line numbers for deletions — those lines don't exist in the new file
- NEVER guess or estimate — count from the hunk header
- If you cannot find the exact line, use `0`
