# Review Agent Authoring Standards

Standards for building Kiro-powered review agents that run as CI jobs on merge requests. Activates automatically when any file under `scripts/review/` is read or modified.

#[[file:.kiro/steering/developer-scripts-authoring.md]]

## Agent Architecture

Each review agent is an independent CI job that:
1. Detects affected packages using `changed-only.py` and `_target_ref()`
2. Collects context (source code, diffs, test files) for each affected package
3. Pipes context through Kiro headless with a steering file for assessment
4. Produces a `report.json` and a GitLab Code Quality JSON report
5. Posts structured GitLab MR discussion threads (summary + detail threads)

The MR Summary agent is a special case — it updates the MR description instead of posting threads.

## Pipeline Blocking Policy

**All agent CI jobs use `allow_failure: false`.** If an agent fails to run (script crash, Kiro timeout, API error), the merge is blocked. The review is required, not optional.

**Finding-level blocking:**
- **BLOCKING findings** (compliance agent only) → review script exits non-zero → merge blocked
- **HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW findings** → review script exits zero → merge proceeds, threads require human acknowledgment
- Only the compliance agent has a BLOCKING tier. Other agents' worst severity is HIGH.

**Rationale:** If the agent can't run, the review didn't happen. MRs should not merge without review. BLOCKING findings represent infrastructure-breaking or security-removing changes that must be addressed before merge. HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW findings are review guidance enforced through the thread acknowledgment workflow.

## Shared Infrastructure — Reuse Rules

Before writing any new code, check these existing components:

| Component | Location | Import/Call |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `_target_ref()` | `review/lib/nx_graph.py` | Import |
| `_load_project_graph()` | `review/lib/nx_graph.py` | Import |
| `_get_transitive_deps()` | `review/lib/nx_graph.py` | Import |
| `PROJECT_ROOT` | `review/lib/nx_graph.py` | Import |
| `run_kiro_assessment()` | `review/lib/kiro_integration.py` | Import |
| `_parse_risk_json()` | `review/lib/kiro_integration.py` | Import |
| `_parse_risk_level()` | `review/lib/kiro_integration.py` | Import |
| `to_codequality_json()` | `review/lib/report.py` | Import |
| `gitlab_api()` | `review/lib/gitlab_threads.py` | Import |
| `get_mr_discussions()` | `review/lib/gitlab_threads.py` | Import |
| `compute_hash()` | `review/lib/gitlab_threads.py` | Import |
| `create_discussion()` | `review/lib/gitlab_threads.py` | Import |
| `resolve_discussion()` | `review/lib/gitlab_threads.py` | Import |
| `_build_diff_position()` | `review/lib/gitlab_threads.py` | Import |
| `_parse_source_position()` | `review/lib/gitlab_threads.py` | Import |
| `compute_source_hash()` | `review/lib/thread_lifecycle.py` | Import |
| `find_thread_by_marker()` | `review/lib/thread_lifecycle.py` | Import |
| `post_or_update_summary()` | `review/lib/thread_lifecycle.py` | Import |
| `post_detail_threads()` | `review/lib/thread_lifecycle.py` | Import |
| `resolve_orphaned_threads()` | `review/lib/thread_lifecycle.py` | Import |
| `check_unresolved_and_exit()` | `review/lib/thread_lifecycle.py` | Import |
| `changed-only.py` | `scripts/nx/changed-only.py` | Subprocess (different purpose directory) |

**Do NOT:**
- Reimplement any of the above
- Import across purpose directories (`scripts/review/` must not import from `scripts/nx/` — call as subprocess)
- Add external pip dependencies — stdlib only

## Thread Naming Convention

Each agent uses a domain-specific label that describes what the finding is:

| Agent | Thread Header | Summary Header |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Compliance | `## {icon} Compliance Risk: {LEVEL}` | `## Compliance Review Summary` |
| Test Standards | `## {icon} Testing Gap: {LEVEL}` | `## Test Standards Review Summary` |
| Module Quality | `## {icon} Quality Concern: {LEVEL}` | `## Module Quality Review Summary` |
| Code Architecture | `## {icon} Architecture Misalignment: {LEVEL}` | `## Architecture Review Summary` |
| Documentation Quality | `## {icon} Documentation Gap: {LEVEL}` | `## Documentation Quality Review Summary` |
| Starter Kit Quality | `## {icon} Quality Concern: {LEVEL}` | `## Starter Kit Quality Review Summary` |

Icons: ❌ BLOCKING, ⚠️ HIGH/MEDIUM, ✅ LOW, ❓ UNKNOWN

## Thread Namespacing

Each agent uses distinct HTML comment markers to identify its threads. Markers must never collide across agents.

| Agent | Detail Marker | Summary Marker |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Baseline (existing) | `<!-- baseline-source:{key} -->` | `<!-- baseline-summary -->` |
| Compliance | `<!-- compliance-source:{file}:{line} -->` | `<!-- compliance-summary -->` |
| Test Standards | `<!-- test-standards-pkg:{name} -->` | `<!-- test-standards-summary -->` |
| Module Quality | `<!-- module-quality-pkg:{name} -->` | `<!-- module-quality-summary -->` |
| Architecture | `<!-- architecture-source:{file}:{hash} -->` | `<!-- architecture-summary -->` |
| Documentation | `<!-- docs-quality-file:{path} -->` | `<!-- docs-quality-summary -->` |
| Starter Kit Quality | `<!-- starter-kit-quality-kit:{name} -->` | `<!-- starter-kit-quality-summary -->` |

## Two-Tier Thread Model

Every review agent follows the same two-tier pattern from the baseline review:

**Tier 1 — Summary thread (resolved):**
- One per MR per agent — **always posted**, even when there are no findings
- When no findings: states the agent ran successfully and found no issues
- When findings exist: provides overview with finding counts by severity, affected packages
- Resolved by default (informational, doesn't block)
- Updated in place on re-runs

**Tier 2 — Detail threads (unresolved):**
- One per finding group (per-package, per-file, or per-source-location depending on agent)
- All severity levels get threads (including LOW)
- Positioned inline on the MR diff when possible via `_build_diff_position()`
- Unresolved — requires human acknowledgment
- Hash-based change detection: skip if unchanged, update and unresolve if changed
- Thread footer includes CI job name so reviewers know what to rerun after resolving

## Thread Lifecycle

Import the shared lifecycle helpers from `review/lib/thread_lifecycle.py` (`compute_source_hash`, `find_thread_by_marker`, `post_or_update_summary`, `post_detail_threads`, `resolve_orphaned_threads`, `check_unresolved_and_exit`) — do not reimplement them:

1. **Compute structural hash** from finding data (excludes prose descriptions)
2. **Find existing thread** via HTML comment marker
3. **If no existing thread** → create new, position inline if possible
4. **If existing thread, hash matches** → skip (no update needed)
5. **If existing thread, hash differs** → edit note in place, unresolve thread with "_Findings have changed since last review. Please re-acknowledge._"

## CI Job Template

```yaml
feature_merge_{agent}_review:
  interruptible: true
  tags:
    - arch:amd64
    - size:medium
  only:
    - merge_requests
  stage: analyze
  dependencies:
    - feature_merge_build_test
  needs:
    - feature_merge_build_test
  cache:
    key: feature-merge-build-$CI_COMMIT_SHA
    paths:
      - node_modules/
      - packages/**/node_modules/
      - .nx/
    policy: pull
  allow_failure: false
  variables:
    GIT_DEPTH: '0'
    KIRO_API_KEY: '${KIRO_API_KEY}'
    KIRO_TIMEOUT: '600'
    KIRO_MAX_THREADS: '5'
  script:
    - python3 ./scripts/review/{agent}/{agent}_review.py --output-dir {agent}-review
    - python3 ./scripts/review/{agent}/post_{agent}_threads.py --report {agent}-review/report.json
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - {agent}-review/report.json
    reports:
      codequality: {agent}-review/codequality-report.json
    when: always
```

## Review Script Pattern

Each `*_review.py` follows the `baseline_review.py` pattern:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
{Agent Name} Review — {one-line description}.

{Detailed description of what it does, numbered steps.}

Outputs:
  {agent}-review/report.json               - Full structured report
  {agent}-review/codequality-report.json   - GitLab Code Quality report for MR diffs

Environment:
  KIRO_API_KEY                     - Required for assessment
  KIRO_TIMEOUT                     - Optional, default 600s
  KIRO_MAX_THREADS                 - Optional, default 5

Usage:
  python3 scripts/review/{agent}/{agent}_review.py [--output-dir {agent}-review]
"""
```

Key implementation points:
- Use `_target_ref()` for git diff base — never hardcode `origin/main`
- Call `changed-only.py` as subprocess with `--extensions .ts` for package detection
- Filter packages by path for agent scope (L2/L3 for compliance, apps for module quality, etc.)
- Parallel Kiro invocations via `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `KIRO_MAX_THREADS`
- Use `run_kiro_assessment(prompt, validate_json=True)` for structured output
- Generate the Code Quality JSON via `to_codequality_json()` from `review/lib/report.py`
- Exit non-zero only for BLOCKING findings (compliance agent) or infrastructure failures

## Thread Lifecycle and Exit Code Logic

After posting/updating all threads, the thread posting script must:

1. **Resolve orphaned threads** — find threads with this agent's marker that don't correspond to any current finding. Auto-resolve them with a note: "_This finding was resolved by code changes. Thread auto-resolved._"
2. **Check for unresolved threads** — re-fetch all discussions, find threads with this agent's marker, check if any are unresolved.
3. **If any unresolved → exit non-zero** (blocks merge)
4. **If all resolved (or no threads) → exit zero** (merge proceeds)

This means:
- New findings → new unresolved thread → job fails → reviewer must resolve to unblock
- Changed findings → thread unresolved → job fails → reviewer must re-resolve
- Unchanged findings with resolved threads → thread skipped → job passes
- No findings → no threads (only summary) → job passes
- Finding disappeared (code fixed) → orphaned thread auto-resolved with note → job passes

## Kiro Prompt Pattern

Each agent's prompt must:
1. Reference the steering file: `#[[file:.kiro/steering/{steering-file}.md]]`
2. Include the relevant context (code diff, source files, test files, etc.)
3. Specify the output file: `Write your assessment to {output_file} as a JSON object.`
4. Include the exact JSON schema the agent expects
5. Include rules for what to include/exclude in findings
6. Use `{output_file}` placeholder (replaced by `run_kiro_assessment()`)

## Wide Impact Escalation

For agents reviewing shared constructs (compliance, architecture):
- If a finding's source is in a shared L2/L3 construct, use `_get_transitive_deps()` to count downstream consumers
- 3+ downstream modules → escalate risk one level
- 5+ → escalate two levels
- 10+ → escalate three levels (max HIGH, never auto-escalate to BLOCKING)
- Note the blast radius in the thread body

Reuse the escalation logic from `post_baseline_threads.py` — `build_root_cause_groups()` builds the per-source groups and `_apply_wide_impact_escalation()` applies the graduated risk bump.

## File Reading Pattern

Each agent reads package files inline — no shared `source_collector` module. Follow the `baseline_review.py` pattern:
- `Path.glob()` + `read_text()` for source files
- `subprocess.run(["git", "diff", ...])` for code diffs
- Truncate large content to stay within Kiro context limits (15-20K chars per section)
- Return empty string if file/directory doesn't exist

## Testing Pattern

All tests in `scripts/review/python-tests/`. Test pure functions only:
- File classification / package filtering
- Prompt construction (verify steering file reference, context inclusion)
- Report generation (mock Kiro responses, verify JSON structure)
- Thread formatting (verify markers, hash computation, body structure)
- Thread lifecycle (mock GitLab API, verify create/update/skip logic)
- Wide impact escalation (mock nx graph, verify risk level changes)

Do NOT test actual subprocess execution, Kiro CLI invocation, or GitLab API calls.
